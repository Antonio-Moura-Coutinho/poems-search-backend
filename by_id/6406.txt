“I will enjoy the echo of their celebrating. And besides, the giant snake-head of the bottle bank is at least a block away. I am helping them.”
“And does that offer you a pleasure in these days of random mass shootings in bars and music venues?”
“Any bottle that has drops of wine in it and no drops of blood pleases me.”
“Do you believe in God, my friend?”
“I am not your friend, good Sir, although I wish you well. And I’ll need at least a year to answer your question.”
“Fine then, tell me, do you differentiate between green, brown, and colorless bottles?”
“No more than the skin colors or hair colors of our citizens.”
“Can I help you, for no recompense, to bring the bottles to the big metal snake?
“Ah, kind sir, I thank you, but some journeys are better taken alone."
