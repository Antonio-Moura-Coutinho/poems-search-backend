
I was involved in the serious businessof ripping apart my own body.I’d run my fingers over it,seeking but never findingthe right point of entry,so having to tear one myself,though midway throughI’d always tire,and let night enterlike a silver needle,sewing my eyelids shut.This was not an original practice,but thinking, for a time, that it wasfelt like being able to choosewhen spring would arrive:engineering an Aprilthat opened like a parasol,even in thoroughest winter.
