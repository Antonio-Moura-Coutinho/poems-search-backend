
There is an ash tree behind this house. Youcan see it from our bedroom window.If you stare at it for long enough, you’ll seeit drop a leaf. Stare at it now, you said,and notice the moment a leaf strips awayfrom its branch, giving a twirl. Consider this.The ash tree unclothes itself Octoberly.From beside our bed, fingering the curtain,observe the dark candles at the top ofthat tree, naked and alert, tending to the breeze.A sheet of ice between the rooftopsand this noiseless sky has turned the airinside out. Black veins of branchesshake against the blue screen on which theyhang. Small mammals are hibernatingin pellets of warm air under ground. But,in spite of the cold, this ash tree does not shyfrom shrugging off its coat, sloping its nudeshoulders to the night. So, you said, undo,unbutton, unclasp, slowly remove. Let down yourhair, breathe out. Stand stark in this room untilwe remember how not to feel the chill.Stand at the window, lift your arms right up like a tree. Yes — like that. Watch leaves drop.
