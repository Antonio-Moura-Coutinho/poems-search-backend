Come for duty’s sake (as girls do) we watchThe sly very old woman wile away from her piousAnd stagger-blind friend, their daily split of gin.She pours big drinks. We think of whatHas crumpled, folded, slumped her flesh inAnd muddied her once tumbling blood that, young,Sped her, threaded with brave power: a Tower,Now Babel, then of ivory, of the Shulamite,Collapsed to this keen dame moving amongHerself. She hums, she plays with used brightGhosts, makes real dolls, and drinking sings Come hereMy child, and feeling it, dear. A crooking fingerShows how hot the oven is.(Also she is alive with hate.Also she is afraid of hell. Also, we wishWe might, illiberal, uncompassionate,Run from her smell, her teeth in the dish.)Even dying, her life riots in her. We stand stock stillThough aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles.We manage to mean well. We endure, and more.We learn time’s pleasure, catch our future and its cure.We’re dear blood daughters to this every hag, and near kinTo any after this of those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us,Presuming us, who are young, to be beautiful, kind, and sure. March 1958
