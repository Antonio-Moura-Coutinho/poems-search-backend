
The cost of flight is landing.On this warm winter day in the southwest,down here on the edge of the border I wantto go to France where we all came fromwhere the Occident was born near the ancientcaves near Lascaux. At home I’m onlysitting on the lip of this black hole, a wellthat descends to the center of the earth.With a big telescope aimed straight downI see a red dot of fire and hear the beast howling.My back is suppurating with disease,the heart lurches left and right,the brain sings its ditties.Everywhere blank white movies wait to be seen.The skylark dove within inches of the rocksbefore it stopped and rose again.God’s toes are buried deep in the earth.He’s ready to run. But where?
