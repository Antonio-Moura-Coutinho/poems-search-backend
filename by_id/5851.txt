Each of us would be testing excellence and endurancein the other, though in the past I’d oftenveer off to follow some feral distractiondown a side path, allowing myselfto pursue something odd or beautiful,becoming acquainted with a few of the waysnot to blame myself for failing to succeed.I had come to believe what’s beautifulhad more to do with daringto take yourself seriously, to staythe course, whatever the course might be.The person in front seemed ready to fade,his long, graceful stride shorteningas I came up along his side. I was sure nowI’d at least exceed my best time.But the man with the famous final kickalready had begun his move. Beautiful, I hearda spectator say, as if something inevitableabout to come from nowhere was again on its way.
