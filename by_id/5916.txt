
I wanted to be seen. But who would see me? I couldn’tthink of the name for anything but a flower. The governmentmakes coins that size and shape so your hand can feelsafe holding them. The pictures stamped remindus where we are, or how the landscapewe live in connects itself, through common value,to a different place. On this one, a spinnakersails past a bridge. On that, a diamond shines like a child’sstilled top over a bird, as if the diamond made the naturalworld — bird, forest, state flower, sheaf of healthy corn, shiningwater — out of proportion in relation to itself. I love this. My own statehas a bear, so small and out of proportion to me that my life-line can cross behind it. At last I do not fearthat but feel proud the animal can sit in my palm so silentlyuntil I spend it. And if I lose it, then it becomeseven more quiet. Most still just have an eagle,so it is as if 30 eagles were passed overfrom one hand to another when the onecharged with arranging things for his Savior’s dinnerarranged his Savior’s death. Heavier the yokeof heat in solitude. A walk uphill does notfeel manageable. Who will see me?
