She stood outside.I stood in, and we cleaned each one that way, staring into each other’s eyes, rubbing the white towel over our faces, rubbingaway hours, years. This is what it was likewhen you were inside me, she said. What? I asked,though I understood. Afterwards, indoors, she smelled like snowmelting. Holding hands we stood by the picture window,gazing into the December sun, watching the pines in flame.
