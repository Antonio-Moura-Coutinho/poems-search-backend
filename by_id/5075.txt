
Silent, about-to-be-parted-from house.Wood creaking, trying to sigh, impatient.Clicking of squirrel-teeth in the attic.Denuded beds, couches stripped of serapes.Deep snow shall block all entrancesand oppress the roof and darkenthe windows.    O Lares,donâ€™t leave.The house yawns like a bear.Guard its profound dreams for us,that it return to us when we return.November 1969
