The heads of the joistsfeathered slowly in the cavity walland the room’s wet belly had begun to bow.Once we’d ripped the boards up, it all came out:the smell, at first, then the crumbling woodgone to seed, all its muscles wasted.You pottered back and to with tea, soda bread,eighty years shaking on a plastic tray.One by one we looked up, nodded, then slippedunder the floor. We moved down there like fishin moonlight, or divers round an old ship.
