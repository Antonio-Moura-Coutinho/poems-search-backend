One afternoon I got restless,flipped through my old yearbooks, trying to find him,looking to see how he might have aged: did he losethe chubby cheeks? dye his hair? how longdid he have to wear braces? But he’s too youngto have passed me in the halls, the picture justa stranger, a small reminder of the whirling aftermathwhen Joplin was clutching at scraps: everything displaced,even this poor kid who doesn’t even know he’s lost.
