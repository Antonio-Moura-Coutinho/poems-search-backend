
I should be diligent and firm,I know I should, and frowning, too;again you’ve failed to clean your room.Not only that, the evidenceof midnight theft is in your bed—cracked peanut shells and m&m’sare crumbled where you rest your head,and just above, the windowsillis crowded with a green giraffe(who’s peering through your telescope),some dominoes, and half a glassof orange juice. You hungry child,how could I be uncharmed by this,your secret world, your happy mess?
