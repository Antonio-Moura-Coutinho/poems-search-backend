Delphine expected to be bored.What she needs to say aloud is smooch.4 Delphine’s heart is more woolen than sure.She nipped off the fur budsfrom the pussy willow and strung theminto a necklace — a means of clustering wants.In the faraway land, her old milk glassholds other people’s toothbrushes and curdling water.5 Precision here is superﬂuous as cut ﬂowers. On the seafrontthe shrubs are meek in the blossoming wind.Delphine has worked on her complexion.Bestowed with peaches, she’s personal limelight.6 At night her cruelties sneak up the ladder of her throat.Its delphinedelphinedelphine on steamed-up mirrors,always in joined-up ﬁnger-writing.7 Singing is only permitted in the dark. Delphine is judgingher own obedience. Look at me being strict! But she hasto remind herself of the rules, hourly. Deceit is its own discipline.8 Today the shrubs are insolent, waiting for adults to prepare a new game.Delphine considers ceremonial magic, but how to practicewithout a little magic escaping?9 Wish yourself into a lovely place, she thinks. Lovelinesswould include shrubs without such expressions!10 Wisdom may well have been squandered on seafrontsand lipstick. So many years afraid of waste is its ownwaste
