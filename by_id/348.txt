
When you asked if it rained bees or poison
you were asking the wrong question. Again.
 
You still didn’t understand the difference
between hurricanes and flooding. Thus between
 
gods and humans. Between your slum-
lordy digs and the shacks I pass that cling
 
to old boards and huddle around each family.
The yards marking the care of home.
 
Everywhere something is falling on
someone and I watch like an autumn
 
tourist tripping through the Berkshires.
I reach to catch a leaf. I try to straighten
 
a Pisa-like sapling. The wind wraps around
us both like a question mark and leaves
 
me standing, the sole witness on this end.
I’m telling you about a place of silence.
 
You want it all to be a metaphor. I’m watching
a front porch crumble. Still, someone sits there.
