Decades go bywhen all I can muster is absent-minded invective,you know, directed at the news;or a brief fantasy of shoving someone in front of a bus. YesterdayI slammed my fist on my deskand then apologized, to the desk.Consider the tapestry of the seven deadly sins, at Saint-Denis:Anger, wild-haired and half-dressed,picked out in blue and silver thread bunched against the crimson,rough against the fingertips, sherides a black boar dappled with bloodand waves her double-headed axe — Yes, I remember her.I always lie when I always sayI didn’t know the gun was loaded.
