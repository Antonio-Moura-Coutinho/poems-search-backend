
Of  that string of memories about our lost friendship I rememberbeing invited places as a pair, like a comedy team; and afterone party, our self-parody of our own stammeringspeechlessness when introduced to Henrik, the Swedish godauto mechanic; our twin, garish, purple-flowered swimsuitsfrom Kmart, outlining, around Texas, our samenessand differences; our dual waitressing shifts across town,and the long phone calls that followed with their emphaticreiteration of every stingy six-top ordering candy-flavoredalcoholic drinks; the after-work visit where we brayed,stomped, then blinked stupidly (while the needle hitthe LP’s end) at the empty fifth of gin left on the coffee table,prompting a dim: Uh oh; your imitation of your mother’shabitual and by-the-way inexplicable confession about youto shoe salesmen: She has a  funny foot; the apartments,the Olivettis, the boyfriends, all the thoughts exchangedunedited like an experiment of the big, walk-in consciousness,which we might have assumed the verbal equivalentof sex for friends, and whatever closeness meant, we wantedas much as we could have, it was our post-graduate workin The Humanities. Even now, I can’t resist striking upa conversation while standing on line, any line, or introducingmyself enthusiastically to whomever I am introduced,but the truth is I am not looking for new friends at this point;I am trying to locate the lost ones, the ones who leftthrough the hole of an argument decades ago,a time more panicked and carefree than any other, except maybethe early years of motherhood, which I missed sharingwith you on playground benches. But surely I will see youon the bus someday, and your greeting will packageour jokes, advice, tears, book talk, our years of reliance.And so I will expect you will tell me how much I havemisunderstood and wrongly assumed in these descriptions,because I never expect those people who have matteredto remain completely gone, even through death, or rebuke.And of course I have to remember what parted us,that I found faults with your other friends, that I spokeas critically and crassly about them as I did about my own person,and to this day I have to be careful of that trait, my junkyarddog of expression, safe only with me on a too-long leash. Here,again, telling you everything with no reason but formemory’s insistence that I string an apology from what I see.
