
God put his finger on my sacrumand he lifted me, he set mein the center of the universe,the curious desireof my chronically lonely life.It was cold and dark and lonelyand I was scared.There were no accessories.I burst into tears over nothing.What would Jimmy Schuyler do?wwjsd?And as quietly as the sound of Kleenexbeing pulled from a box,I sneezed.And morning, that goddess,as if she were slightly deaf,barely lifted her head off the horizonbefore laying back down.And a rose opened her portalsand the scent ran up an elephantâ€™s trunk,or tried to.Such a long way for everything to travel!From here I look like a front moving inAn icy purple lighta poet would say belonged to a perfume stopperbelonging to his mother.When it was her nipple.You know, neither in the pastor in the future.
