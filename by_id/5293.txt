Someone’s playing a dulcimerNorthampton-style, on the porch out back.Its voice touches and parts the air of summer,as if  it swam to time us down a riverwhere we dive and leave a single trackas evening falls. Someone’s playing a dulcimerthat lets us wash our mix of dreams together.Delicate, tacit, we engage in our act;its voice touches and parts the air of summer.When we disentangle you are not with herI am not with him. Redress calls for tact.Evening falls. Someone’s playing a dulcimerstill. A small breeze rises and the leaves stiras uneasy as we, while the woods go black;its voice touches and parts the air of summerand lets darkness enter us; our strings go slackthough the player keeps up his plangent attack.Evening falls. Someone’s playing a dulcimer;its voice touches and parts the air of summer.
