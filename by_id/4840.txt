I saw the shrouds of prisonerslike baptismal gownsburied outside the cemetery.On the canvas frills exhaledsinged wool and cardboard.The angels arrived as lace.Took notes, then stuck. Awful residuefrom a small cut.                                 •The veil has been ripped from the skinwhere it was burned in.The skin is the veil, the baby-material,imprinted on, as ifone dropped the handkerchiefand it was one’s wrist.The cuff is frightening.  Stuffed onto oil.Water-stains might fence its ghost in.                                 ﻿•“The barbed wire complex”I understand.  Winged and flattenedat the same time, poor things!Some leftover specters of blood.Remember Blake’s figures like columnswith headslooking around for God?When events are not as randomas they seem.                                 ﻿•The article of clothingis only half there, it’s not full,but when it falls forward, it is.Terrible emptiness of the spreadneckline and little sleeve.Half-cooked squares.Was this religious fireand is this where it passed?Maybe they are floating on waterof paint, pool-sized, blue and ridged like foam.You would have to flyto see them flat as a map.The rib and hem. Rained onfor eons. Noah’s children’sfloating forms.                                 ﻿•Angels die?It’s a frightening-miracle because here they are.The Upper Godhas let them droplike centuries into space.And I recognize them!
