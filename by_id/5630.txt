She said she sang very close to the miketo change the space. And I changed the spaceby striding down the Boulevard Raspail at dusk in tight jeansuntil an Algerian engineer plucked the pen from my back pocket.As if you’re inside my head and you’re hearing the song from in there.He came from the desert, I camefrom green suburbs. We understoodnothing of one another over glasses of metallic red wine.I was playing Girl. He playedMan. Several plots were afoot, allmisfiring. One had to do with my skimpy black shirtand light hair, his broad shoulders and hungerafter months on an oil rig. Anotherwas untranslatable. Apollinaireburned his fingers on June’s smoldering lyrebut I had lost my pen. The engineerread only construction manuals. His roomwas dim and narrow and no,the story didn’t slide that way though there are many waysto throw oneself away.One singer did it by living by a broken walluntil she shredded her voice but still she offered each song,she said, like an Appalachian artifact.Like trash along the riverbank chafing at the quayplastic bottles a torn shirt fractured dollsthrough which the current chortles an intimate tune.
