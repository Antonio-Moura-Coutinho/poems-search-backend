First the sky was yellowthen white snow followed.On a handwas an amethyst: a cube of  lilac in hospital light. • Whose fault is it when no one visits?• Last night I dreamedI was in a peaceful placebut woke upfreezing and ashamed.On a side street (on my sheets)one I loved passedas a shadow.Maddish, reddish, his fistclenched for a fight.• I recalledhis body colorbeing soft like a child.The drunken nipples.• Honey I called.We were too late.God and the gods have movedoutside the jeweled airand sun motes   ...    to where a star is:an amethyst minus a poet.
