
I was always a thoughtful youngster,Said the lady on the omnibus,I remember Father used to say,You are more thoughtful than us.I was sensitive too, the least thingUpset me so much,I used to cry if a flyStuck in the hatch.Mother always said,Elsie is too good,There’ll never be another like Elsie,Touch wood. I liked to be alone,Sitting on the garden path,My brother said he’d never seen aPicture more like Faith in the Arena.They were kindly people, my people,I could not help being different,And I think it was good for meMixing in a different element.The poor lady now burst out cryingAnd I saw her friend was not a friend but a nurseFor she said, Cheer up duckie the next stop is ours,They got off at Northumberland House.This great House of the PerciesIs now a lunatic asylum,But over the gate there still standsThe great Northumberland Lion.This family animal’s tailIs peculiar in that it is absolutely straight,And straight as a bar it stood out to drop after themAs they went through the gate.November 1964
