I’m condemned to rhymeUntil the Christmas special end of time. That’s Jodi, my human friend.The world goes on and on and will not endHiya there Jodi. Oh hi Sam. Jodi straightens Jeffrey’s magic tam. Everything’s safe here let’s go upstairsSam says through a moustache Props repairs. Jodi is so pretty. I hate her. She carries Jeffrey up the escalatorTo the kid’s department every nightWhere he turns into space and starlight When I say the magic rhyme. Jeff’s a mannequin Until the mall goes dark. Then he’s a man again.
