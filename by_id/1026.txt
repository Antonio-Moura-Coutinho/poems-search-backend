Years love trees in a way we can’t imagine. They just don’t use the fruit like us; they want instead the slantof sun through narrow branches, the buckshot of rain on these old cherries. And we, now that I think on it, want those things too, we just always and desperatelywant the sugar of the fruit, the best we’ll get from this irascible land: sweetness we can gather for years, new stains staining the stains on our hands.
