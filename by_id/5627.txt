
A pair of Orpingtons,one blue, the other black,with iridescent necksand fine, ashen fluffcackle through the dark,their damp calls close enoughto chafe, a friction with no spark.They settle down to roost,two rests along a stave.Each curls into itself,comb tucked beneath a wing,as the days grow long enoughto kindle in each a yolk,the smallest flame of spring.
