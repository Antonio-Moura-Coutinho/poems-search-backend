
They pluck my sleeve, tug my hand, pullmy hair. They do not kneel to kiss my hem.No, it’s not like that but they want tokens.Again, not souvenirs but something smalland useful, something that will help them outafter life, maybe in an underworld.They need a sighted guide to lead them tothe river, and they need a remnant ofthe old world as they embark for the older world,the one that has existed since the firstgrievous death. They need to feel they stillcan touch and still be touched, as once they didand were, and one would have to be a cold,uncaring woman to deny their pleas:a woman with a bulletproof  heart,without a memory of life on earth.
