
I’ll fly off to a fjord in Norway,post “Oh the pain” above my doorwayif you insist on going your way,           for this is not a duck.That is what cowards say, and realistswho run away, shun the appeal itsrare white fur holds, although they feel it’s           a rabbit full of pluck.Let’s multiply, let’s twitch our noses,let’s walk among the night’s dark roses,though where the oldest story goes is           a place where tongues might cluck.I’ve had my share of quacks and hisses;whereof mouth cannot speak, it kisses;hop to it, man, and realize this is           a lovely bit of luck.
