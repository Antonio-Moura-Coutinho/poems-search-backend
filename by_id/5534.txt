His kneesone by one welcomed the snow and brought him into the warmth.He stood up and breathed deeply.He held a foot up to the flamesthen swapped it for the other foot.He lay down on the polar bear rugbut a smell yanked him upright againand led him to a dresser of â€Šbonewhere a bowl sat with a cover on it.He lifted this to reveal dried meat.He grabbed a chunk and tore at itwith his teeth. It was reindeer.He devoured all that was in the bowland went looking for some more.He found none, but there was a bottleof firewater which he swigged.He swigged again and left it down.He lay on the bearskin and fell asleep.
