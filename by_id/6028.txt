I won’t get started.history is what it is. it knows what it did.bad dog. bad blood. bad day to be a boycolor of a July well spent. but here, not earthnot heaven, boys can’t recall their white shirtturned a ruby gown. here, there is no languagefor officer or law, no color to call white.if snow fell, it’d fall black. please, don’t callus dead, call us alive someplace better.we say our own names when we pray.we go out for sweets & come back. • this is how we are born: come morningafter we cypher/feast/hoop, we diga new boy from the ground, takehim out his treebox, shake wormsfrom his braids. sometimes they’ll singa trapgod hymn (what a first breath!)sometimes it’s they eyes who leadscanning for bonefleshed men in blue.we say congrats, you’re a boy again! we give him a durag, a bowl, a second chance.we send him off to wander for a dayor ever, let him pick his new name.that boy was Trayvon, now called RainKing.that man Sean named himself I do, I do.O, the imagination of a new reborn boybut most of us settle on alive. • sometimes a boy is bornright out the sky, dropped froma bridge between starshine & clay.one boy showed up pulled behinda truck, a parade for himself& his wet red gown. years agowe plucked brothers from branchesunpeeled their naps from bark.sometimes a boy walks into his roomthen walks out into his new worldstill clutching wicked metals. some boyswaded here through their own blood. does it matter how he got here if we’re all hereto dance? grab a boy, spin him around.if he asks for a kiss, kiss him.if he asks where he is, say gone. • no need for geographynow that we’re safe everywhere.point to whatever you please& call it church, home, or sweet love.paradise is a world where everythingis a sanctuary & nothing is a gun. here, if it grows it knows its placein history. yesterday, a poplar told me of old forestheavy with fruits I’d call unclebursting red pulp & set afire, harvest of dark wind chimes. after I fell from its limbit kissed sap into my wound.do you know what it’s like to livesomeplace that loves you back?• here, everybody wanna be black & is. look — the forest is a flock of boyswho never got to grow up, bloominginto forever, afros like maple crowns reaching sap-slow toward sky. watchForest run in the rain, branchesmelting into paper-soft curls, duckunder the mountain for shelter. watchthe mountain reveal itself a boy. watch Mountain & Forest playingin the rain, watch the rain melt everythinginto a boy with brown eyes & wet naps — the lake turns into a boy in the rainthe swamp — a boy in the rainthe fields of lavender — brothersdancing between the storm. • if you press your ear to the dirtyou can hear it hum, not like it’s filledwith beetles & other low godsbut like a mouth rot with gospel& other glories. listen to the dirtcrescendo a boy back. come. celebrate. this is everyday. every day holy. everyday high holiday. everyday new year. every year, days get longer. time clogged with boys. the boysO the boys. they still comein droves. the old world keeps choking them. our new one can’t stop spitting them out. • ask the mountain-boy to put you onhis shoulders if you want to seethe old world, ask him for some lean-in & you’ll be home. step off him& walk around your block.grow wings & fly above your city.all the guns fire toward heaven.warning shots mince your feathers.fall back to the metal-less sideof the mountain, cry if you need to.that world of laws rendered us into dark matter. we asked for nothing but our namesin a mouth we’ve known for decades. some were blessed to know the mouth.our decades betrayed us. • there, I drowned, back before, once. there, I knew how to swim but couldn’t.there, men stood by shore & watched me blue.there, I was a dead fish, the river’s prince. there, I had a face & then I didn’t.there, my mother cried over mebut I wasn’t there. I was here, by my ownwater, singing a song I learned somewheresouth of somewhere worse. that was whendirection mattered. now, everywhere I am is the center of everything.I must be the lord of something. what was I before? a boy? a son?a warning? a myth? I whistlednow I’m the God of whistling.I built my Olympia downstream. • you are not welcome here. trustthe trip will kill you. go home.we earned this paradise by a death we didn’t deserve.I am sure there are other heres.a somewhere for every kindof somebody, a heaven of brown girls braiding on golden stoopsbut here — how could I ever explain to you —  someone prayed we’d rest in peace & here we are  in peace             whole                all summer
