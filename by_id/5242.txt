You are trembling now like the librarian reading                                  To herself out loud in her Arctic roomComposed entirely of snow.A broadcast (high fidelity) bound by the quiet of the land andThe Mennonite who told him                                We are in this world, but are not of this world,You see. From the notebook of  your partial list of symptoms, phobias:Fever, paranoia, polio (subclinical), ankle-foot phenomenon, The possibility of  bluish spots. Everything one does is fearNot being of this world or in this world enough.                                There is no world I know, without some word of   it.
