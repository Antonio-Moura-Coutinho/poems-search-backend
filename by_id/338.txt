
For all
the pain
 
passed down
the genes
 
or latent
in the very grain
 
of being;
for the lordless
 
mornings,
the smear
 
of spirit
words intuit
 
and inter;
for all
 
the nightfall
neverness
 
inking
into me
even now,
my prayer
 
is that a mind
blurred
 
by anxiety
or despair
 
might find
here
 
a trace
of peace.
