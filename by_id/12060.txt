It’s all becometoo much for them, and they’re all on the soma. It makes sense with these pills when the someonethey thought they loved for yearsby never thinking about it says, “I don’t love you anymore,but let’s stay friends in that mellowwoebegone way poetry now sings without singing.” Of course, they’re always asking “What is poetry?”and then answering by saying it’s what Boethius was thinking aboutwhen they squished his headuntil his eyes popped out, or anything barbaric enough to geteveryone to stop eating for a bitand reach for a moment past a chatty moment. Sort of a solution to awkward goodbyes. How money becomes a sort of welcome relief that defuses the poetry charging tense moments. “Interesting,”someone remarks between bites, “to be right here in the momentyet also out there watching some once-in-a-lifetime sublimity unfold, as if living as if already dead.” As if standing in a dream far up in the stars somewhere with Scipio
