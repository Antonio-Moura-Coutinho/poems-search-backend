Some knew the native tongues;they called themselves by new namesin the eastern twilight, different parts of their soulnever having learned to live together.Skies burned. Dust covered the palmsand minarets as they arrived by the incandescent shoreof our city, each with his own little dreams and disasters.Some remained, never to be heard of again.Some left with caravans, wearing native dress — ephemerids.Where are they? What are they used to?The only preserved interview — concerning an artist and explorer. Did he ever speak of his friends in X? Never. The only thing he liked in X was his sister. But did you know that he painted? Oh yes! — some fine things: stemware, a series of watercolors of shoebills and Abdim’s stork.
