
She visits still too much, dressed in aromasof fir needles, mango, mold: I still get lostknowing she’s close, me not getting youngeror more conscious. Sometimes I fantasticateI’m broad awake: her witchy presence waitsfor me to jump into her arms, but then she’s justan incoherent ache in sleep’s freaked scenes.I feel her frosty nitrogenous hands and wristsvaporing nooses around my head and feetand genitals, conjuring my drab hairinto a party bowl of oiled, desirable locks.She makes me nervous, but what would I dowithout her? So long as I can’t have her,I want her and this alarming manic frequency.Then again, who wants to wake to change,its pulped, smelly suit of meat, drawing flies?My night-watch hot girl, moon-maiden, mom,let me get just one night’s sleep without regret,released from your foxy ticklish fondlings,your latest smell of windblown fresh-cut grass.
