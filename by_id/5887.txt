
Emptied, precious, querulous, frail,a box of butter biscuits by the bedside,dun pills in a pale plastic tray,your grandmother lies in her tiny bonesand mumbles, mysterious, while you say nothing,barely thirteen, blank as the day.You were to keep an eye on herbreathing, her little bones heaving,and your eyes scan figurines, mementoson the windowsill — Little Bo Peep has losther head — and green fields through the window:hay barns, small farms, a chicken battery shed.Bwwaaakk! Buck-back-bock-buckaaaakk!Rows upon rows of chickens.There was a funnel hung from a gibbetthat swung like a big steel conical conundrumabove their dun feathers — the colorof your grandmother’s tights scrumpled on the floor.Even a year before, she would have swoonedfor shame at the sight of those tights half-trailedunder her bed, their crinkled wee anklesjouking out, as if they had crawled underand tipped their wrinkled cargo into the void — your grandmother in bed, waiting for the spoon.Her weak breath does not reach heavenbut hazes among the chipped figurines,the dull color television’s black screen,fading flesh-colored flowers on the wall-paper, dun as the wings of those dirt-crustedrows upon rows of throbbing chickens.When you dropped one into the funnelits head pushed through that blood-rimmed Oto stare chicken-eyed at the other side,blackened numbles and gibletsupon which it would soon streamlike warm port, its feet still in a fidget.What gets passed on, through generations?Your grandmother tries to speak. Her bonyfingers clutch your hand — and you bendyour head down. But you’d get more sensefrom the sea in a seashell as your fatherenters the room beaming, Well! Well?
