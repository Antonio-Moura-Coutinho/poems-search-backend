Here in the gloaming,
a wormwood haze — 
the “m” on its head,
a “w,” amazed
at what the
drink itself does:
Vermouth,
god bless you — th.2
What really matters now is begonia,
he thought, distracted while reading — 
their amber anther and bone-white petals
missing from a jade pot
by the door — not a theory of metaphor.3
In this corner, sweet alyssum.
And beside it fragrant jessamine.
Almost rhyming scents in the air — 
a syntax weaving their there, there.4
Erodium holds
an eye in the pink
looping the white of
its tendering cup.5
The blue moon opens all
      too quickly and floats
      its head-
                     y fragrance over
                               the path
                  before us:
And so we slit
its throat, like a florist.6
These hearts-on-strings
     of the tenderest green
things that rise
from dirt,
then fall
                  toward the floor,
                                  hang
                            in
               the air
         like — 
              hearts-
on-strings of the tenderest
green things — 
     they rise from dirt
then fall toward
           the floor,
    hanging in
                the air like — 
                                 these
hearts-on-strings of the
tenderest green things,
                                       rising
from dirt then falling
toward the floor,
             hanging
      in the air like7
Moss-rose, purslane, portulaca
           petals feeling
     for the sun’s
light or is it
only warmth
or both

to open)
an amethyst
           almost
see-through

Bou-
          gainvillea
lifts the sinking
spirit back
           up and nearly
into a buoyancy — 
      its papery
pink bracts
proving with
their tease
     of a rustle and glow
through the window — 
there is a breeze.9
Epistle-like chicory
blue beyond
the bars of these
    beds suspended
                  in air,
(what doesn’t dangle?)
elsewhere, gives
way to plugged in,
pez-
             purply thyme,
against a golden
(halo’s) thistle.10
What’s a wandering
Jew to you
two, who often do
wonder about
that moving about?
Its purple stalk
torn-off and stuck
elsewhere in
the ground takes root
and soon shoots
forth a bluish
star with powder
on its pistil.
Such is the power
of that Jew,
wherever it goes
(unlike the rose),
to make itself new.
