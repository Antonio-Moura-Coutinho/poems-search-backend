
All summer, the city engine's low
roar capsizes our bodies into sleep,
groans,
                evacuation—
                                                   Lost to a watery
anamnesis so warm it requires a raft
thatched from death's
                                         flotsam to necklace its shore
                              I swim on, calling your name
In my dreams, something is always deserting
But tonight, no fast shadows of birds
No oceanic flowers disrobing butterflies
or bright beach of child's porridge and bones—
                                                                                 Instead, someone weaving
a net from fallen hair in and around our bed
to catch the breath, blood, and ritual
motions that oiled us
                                            as one candle in a cave
In your dreams, someone is always resisting being savedMy teeth are on fire, you say I saidDon't fly for the labyrinth, once
I thought you were admonishing me to go away
I don't remember most others, a thousand seasons
phonographed in through a wounded windowEveryone can't have a cactus
Just o.k. empty all the rice from my legs
