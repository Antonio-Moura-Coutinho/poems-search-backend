Also that the same man had named Lucy’s twin brother,born dead, Jesus Christ. These facts, he said,along with his tattoos and Mohawked black hair,we should, in our toils on his behalf, remember.As we should also always remember to call himonly by that otherwise most womanly diminutive,and never, he warned, by his given nor surname,least of all with the title “Mister” attached,which would remind him of that same most hated fatherand plunge him therefore into a moodhe could not promise he would, he said, “behave appropriately within.” Fortunately, our job,unlike the social difficulties attached thereto,was simple: collect the trash from the county’s back roads.Although, given Lucy’s insistence on thoroughness,this meant not only beer cans and bottles,all manner of cast-off paper and plastics, but alsothe occasional condom too, as well as the festeringroadkill fresh and ridden with maggotry,or desiccate and liftable only from the hot summer tarwith a square-bladed shovel, all of which was to be tossedinto the bed of the township flatbed truck we ourselvesrode to and from the job in. By fifty-yard incrementsthen we traveled. He was never not smoking a cigarette.Late every afternoon, at the dump, while we unloadedour tonnage of trash, he sat with Stump McCarriston,sexton of the dump and the dump’s constant resident,in the shade, next to a green, decrepit trailerwe marveled at and strangely envied, since every inchof wall we could see through the open doorwas plastered with fold-outs and pagesfrom every Stump-salvaged Playboy and nudie magazinehe had ever found among the wreckage there.Stump, we understood, was the ugliest man on earth.Even had Lucy not told us so, we would have known,by the olfactory rudeness within twenty yardsof his hovel, that he never bathed. And once,while we shoveled and scraped, he took up the .22from the rack beside his door and poppedwith amazing accuracy three rats not fifty feet from us,then walked to their carcasses, skinned them out,and hung their hides on a scavenged grocery store rackto dry. He was making, Lucy explained, a rat hidecoat we could see, come the fall, except for school.As for school, it was a concept Stump could not fathomand Lucy had no use for, on the truck’s dashall that summer Robert Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy,a tome he said he’d read already eleven times,this summer being the twelfth. We thought, in some way,it might have had to do with something like the galleryStump’s trailer contained, the first word of its titlemeaning something to us, the last nothing at all.There were things about men we might beunable ever to know, which we somehow knew was lucky.And Lucky, incidentally, was the name of the cat,fat and mangy, that, once Stump was back in the shadewith Lucy, began, one by one, to consume the hideless rats.The town we came from was sinking into the emptinessof a thousand abandoned coal mine shafts beneath it,and rats were more common than haresand universally despised. They shamed us, it seemed,as we were shamed by ignorance and curiosity—the bodies of those women on the walls, the provenanceof rats the very earth offered up like a plague,the burden of a name like Lucifer or Stump,whose name, as it was scrawled on his mailbox,seemed to be Stumplin Reilly McCarriston, Esquire.Of the seven of us, one would die in Vietnam,one, after medical school, would hang himselffrom a beam in his parents’ basement, the othersmerely gone, vanished in actuality if not in memory.Leaving me, alone, to tell this story. How Stumpwould spend his last twenty years in prison,having shot Lucy—one slender, flattening .22 slugthrough the forehead—as he stood fifty feet away, balanced atop the tub of an ancient wringer washer,arms extended, like Jesus Christ, said Stump,whose trailer was bulldozed into the dump itselfeven before the trial, and who, no doubt, by somecourt-appointed lawyer if not the appalled sheriff himself,was forced to bathe and shave, to step into the unknown countryof a scentless white shirt and black businessman’s trousers,in order to offer his only yet most sincere defense,that Lucifer—Mr. Doolin, as the court insisted—had told him to.
