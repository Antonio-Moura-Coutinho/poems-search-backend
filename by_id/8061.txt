C’est sous terre;

Our diaries squatted, toad-like,   
      On dark closet ledges.   
      Forget-me-not and thistle   
      Decalcomaned the pages.
      But where, where are they now,
         All the sad squalors
      Of those between-wars parlors?—
Cut flowers; and the sunlight spilt like soda
      On torporous rugs; the photo   
      Albums all outspread ...
            The dead
Don’t get around much anymore.
