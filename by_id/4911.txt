Kings, Pharaohs had themfabricated, poured out in gold and beaten.Most wore them to the grave. In Mexicothe living wear them, not to scare the deadaway, but as invitation. They leave candyon the mounds of those they mourn. NewOrleans? Women wear them in orderto bare everything else. Men wear themin order to watch. I can remember, backbefore it all grows grim, making oneout of the news, trying to paste it together. I remember my mother helping me. I don’t really remember my father. Somethinglike a face, like the man in the moon.I understand we’re hardwired this way,to make faces before anything else.It’s why we see the Madonna in mold,alien architecture in Martian crater creep.We keep looking for those first faces, firstfamilia. Every culture, every eon. Witness the oldest we know, his cave, his wall, onehundred seventy centuries gone. They call him Sorcerer. They call me Knight.We have always lived in the dark.
