And vinyl siding’s tooregular — each molded, faux-grained stripidentical, but for dents, and that dripof   bird shit from a sill. What if all youmight say speaks like crafted, ersatz things:mimicry in a tongue you barely know?Your owl signs death, the cornice stone, the fakeclapboard conjures farmhouse. While just belowthe ledge, a wren’s mindless gestures makean altar of twigs, in veneration of wings.
