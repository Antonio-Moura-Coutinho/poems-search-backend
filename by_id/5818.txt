Waters apart from society by choice, their living room the aftermath of accident or crime. When the storm comes,we will see into it, there will be no near and no far. In sixty-five-foot  seasfor the Ocean Ranger, green turned to black then white as moleculeschanged places in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin, the way wood passes intoflame, and communication errors into catastrophic failurefor the Piper Alpha offshore from Aberdeen.It burned freely. If I don’t come home, is my house in order?Big fear travels in the Sikorsky. Twelve-hour shifts travel with them, the deluge system, aqueous foam. Machinery’s one notehammering the heart, identity compressed with intentions, drenched,the tired body performs delicately timed, brutal tasks no trainingadequately represents and which consume the perceivable world.In beds on the drilling platform in suspended disbelief,identified by the unlovely sea’s aggression, no sleep aids,should a directive come. Underwater welders deeply unconscious.Survival suits profane in lockers. By dreams of marine flaresand inflatables, buoyant smoke, percolating fret,one is weakened. Violence enters the imagination.Clouds previously unrecorded. Unlocked, the gates of lightand technology of capture in bitumen oozing from fracturesin the earth or afloat like other fatty bodies, condensedby sun and internal salts, harassing snakes with its fumes.Light-sensitive bitumen of Judea upon which Joseph-Nicéphore Niépcerecorded the view from his bedroom. It looked nice. A new kindof evidence developed from the camera obscura of experienceand memory, love-object to dote on and ignore. Collectible photochrome postcards. Storm surge as weather segment,tornados on YouTube relieve us of our boredom. In the rain, drizzle, intermittent showers, unseasonable hurricane threatening our flight plans, against a sea heaving photogenically, straining at its chains like a monster in the flashbulbs, on wet stones astonishingly slick, we take selfies, post them, and can’t undo it.Meaning takes place in time. By elevated circumstance of Burtynsky’s drone helicopters, revolutionary lenses pester Alberta’s tar sands, sulphur ponds’ rhapsodic upturned faces, photographs that happen in our name and in the name of composition. Foreground entered at distance, the eye surveils the McMurray Formation’s freestanding ruin mid-aspect to an infinity of abstraction. A physical symptom assails our vocabulary and things acquire a literal feeling from which one does not recover. Mineral dissolution, complete. Accommodation space, low. Confinement, relatively broad, extremely complex stratigraphy, reservoirs stacked and composite. An area roughly the sizeof England stripped of boreal forest and muskeg, unburdened by hydraulic rope shovels of its overburden. Humiliated,blinded, walking in circles. Cycle of soak and dry and residue. The will creates effects no will can overturn, and that seem, with the passage of time, necessary, as the past assumes a pattern. Thought approaches the future and the future, like a heavy unconventional oil, advances. Hello infrastructure, Dodge Ram 1500, no one else wants to get killed on Highway 63, the all-weather road by the Wandering River where earthmovers remain unmoved by our schedules. White crosses in the ditches, white crosses in the glove box. The west stands for relocation, the east for lost causes. Would you conspire to serve tourists in a fish restaurant the rest of your life? I thought not. Drinks are on us bushpigs now, though this camp is no place for a tradesman. Devon’s Jackfish is five-star, an obvious exception. But Mackenzie, Voyageur, Millennium, Borealis —years ago we would have burned them to the ground. Suncor Firebag has Wi-Fi, but will track usage. Guard towers and turnstiles at Wapasu —we’re guests, after all, not prisoners, right? Efficiently squalid, briskly producing raw sewage, black mold, botulism, fleas, remorse, madness, lethargy, mud, it’s not a spiritual home, this bleach taste in the waterglass, layered garments, fried food, bitter complaint in plywood drop-ceiling bedrooms strung outon whatever and general offense and why doesn’t anyone smoke anymore. Dealers and prostitutes cultivate their terms organically, as demand matures. The Athabasca River’s color isn’t good.Should we not encourage a healthy dread of the wild places?Consider the operator crushed by a slab of ice, our electrician mauled by a bear at the front lines of project expansioninto the inhumane forest. Fear not, we are worth more than many sparrows.They pay for insignificance with their lives. It’s the structure.Jackpine Mine photographs beautifully on the shoulders of the day,in the minutes before sunset it’s still legal to hunt. One might,like Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer, at a certain removefrom principal events, cut a sensitive figure in the presenceof the sublime. Except you can smell it down here. Corrosivevapors unexpectedly distributed, caustic particulate infiltratesyour mood. As does the tar sands beetle whose bite scars, from whomgrown men run. Attracted by the same sorrowful chemical compoundemitted by damaged trees on which it feeds, its aural signatureapproximates the rasp of causatum rubbing its parts together.The only other living thing in situ, in the open pit where swims the bitumen, extra brilliant, dense, massive, in the Greek asphaltos,“to make stable,” “to secure.” Pharmacist’s earth that resists decay,resolves and attenuates, cleanses wounds. Once used to burnthe houses of our enemies, upgraded now to refinery-ready feedstock,raw crude flowing through channels of production and distribution. Combustion is our style. It steers all things from the black graveof Athabasca-Wabiskaw. Cold Lake. Rail lines ofLac-Mégantic. The optics are bad. We’re all downstream now.Action resembles waiting for a decision madeon our behalf, then despair after the fact. Despair which,like bitumen itself, applied to render darker tones or an emphatictenebrism, imparts a velvety lustrous disposition,but eventually discolors to a black treacle that degradesany pigment it contacts. Details in sections of Raft of the Medusacan no longer be discerned. In 1816, the Medusa’s captain,in a spasm of flamboyant incompetence, ran agroundon the African coast, and fearing the ire of his constituents,refused to sacrifice the cannons. They turned on each other,147 low souls herded onto a makeshift raft cut loose from lifeboatsof the wealthy and well-connected. The signs were there,risk/reward coefficient alive in the wind, the locomotive,small tragic towns left for work, where the only thing manufactured is the need for work. Foreshortening and a receding horizoninclude the viewer in the scene, should the viewer wishto be included in the scene. One can’t be sure if the brig, Argus,is racing to the rescue or departing. It hesitates in the distance,in its nimbus of fairer weather, the courage and compassionof a new age onboard. Géricault’s pyramidical composition —dead and dying in the foreground from which the strong succeed upwardtoward an emotional peak —an influence for Turner’s Disaster at Sea, the vortex structure ofThe Slave Ship: all those abandoned, where is thy market now?It’s difficult to imagine everyone saved, it’s unaffordable. Wavesdisproportionate, organized in depth, panic modulatingthe speaking voice. The situation so harshly primary and not beautifulwhen you don’t go to visit the seaside, but the seaside visits you,rudely, breaks in through the basement, ascends stairsto your bedroom, you can’t think of it generally then. The  constitutionof things is accustomed to hiding. Rearrangement will not suit us.Certain low-lying river deltas. Island states, coastal regions —floodwaters receding in measures like all we haven’t seen the last ofreveal in stagnancies and bloat what’s altered, as avernal exhalationsof mines and flares are altered but don’t disappear. Still,iceberg season is spectacular this year, worth the tripto photograph in evening ourselves before the abundance when, aflamein light that dissolves what it illuminates, water climbs its own red walls, vermilion in the furnaces.
