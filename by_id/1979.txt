
How well its squarefit my palm, my mouth, a toasty wafer slipped onto the sick tongueor into chicken soup,each crisp saltine a tile pierced with 13 holes in rows of 3 and 2,its edges perforated like a postage stamp,one of a shifting stack sealed in wax paper whose noisy opening always signaled snack, peanut butter or cheesethick inside Premiums,the closest we ever gotto serving hors d’oeuvres:the redneck’s hardtack, the cracker’s cracker.
