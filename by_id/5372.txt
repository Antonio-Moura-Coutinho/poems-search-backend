The camera pans to anotherpocket of  the room where six kids rocking holeyT-shirts etch aerosol lines on warehouse wallsin words I cannot comprehend. All of thishappening in a time no older than your lastheartbeat. I’ve been told the internet isan unholy place — an endless intangiblestumbling ground of false deities dogma and loneliness, sad as a pile of shitin a world without flies. My loneliness exists in every afterthought. Yesterday, I watcheda neighbor braid intricate waves of cornrowsinto her son’s tiny head and could have lived in her focus-wrinkled brow for a living. TodayI think I practice the religion of  blinking too much.Today, I know no neighbor’s name and won’tknow if  I like it or not. O holy streaming screen of counterculture punks, linger my lit mindon landing strips — through fog, rain, hail — without care for time or density. O worldwide web, o viral video, o god of excrement thought. Befriend me. Be fucking infectious.Move my eyes from one sight to the next.
