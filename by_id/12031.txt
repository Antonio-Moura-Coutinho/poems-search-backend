
You are for me as you cannot beFor yourself, chaos without demandTo speak, the amethyst nothingHidden inside the trinket shop’s stone,Dark eyes dark asterisks where lightFootnotes a margin left blank. YouDon’t look up to look up at the sky. Your ears parenthesize nothingThat occurs, that I keep from occurring,In the poem, on the page, as you areFor me, not a shadow, but a shadeWhose darkness drops from no objectBut is itself yourself, a form of timeSpanning nothing, never is your name.
