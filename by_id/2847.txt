Laid on the surfaceof the Ganges, the thin shells reflected light, clamoredagainst the current. Far from the Atlantic, farther stillfrom the Potomac. Same color of night, dull dawn.The fever should have churned my blood into tightfists while the sunset stretched across the skylike an open mouth. Everything was splintered heat.I'd awake to winter in D.C., find streets coveredin snow, the words of some ancient language bloomingunder my ankles like a song, a mantra called home.I could trace it like a geography of someone I had once been.How to explain the hum of mosquitos in my ear, sensualand low, nothing like the sound of rusted-out engines,police sirens, a train's whistle. How easily I'd lost the tastefor that water, opened my legs to their hot, biting mouths.
