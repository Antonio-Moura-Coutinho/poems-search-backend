I am not a woman, Iam a man. Made in His image.I keep the house, a gray Cape Cod,and broom it well. I wear a skirt to becomfortable. I build the fire.When my husband comes home I don’t pester Him with questions.He knows where to find His slippers and His pipe.Out our kitchen back door I see the prophets freight-hoppingthe long bad Western in ancient Englishthat no one need read to know. Everyone speaks his part:the women keep their heads downwhile the men are losing theirs. Children?How often I’ve prayed for a child, which meansslipping meaning looks to my husband as we rocktogether on the porch of an evening, drinking lemonadeand playing Scrabble. If He lets me winit’s a sign. I haven’t won yet.But the neighbor children come and goand take the pies cooling on the windowsillwithout thanks. Sometimes terrible thingshappen to them — some manspills the bloodcradled so carefully in every hand. I acceptno blame. The pies were there to leave alone,or not. God says nothingbut taps out His pipe, stands, with a handto ease His aching back. Time for bed.Our bed is a rolling ocean that I tread alonejust a head bobbing above the ash-colored waveswhile the moon waits for me and everythingto drown, to know again the peacethe moon knows, the silence interrupted by astronauts,little green men, the spectacle a mothercan’t help but make of  herself. Godcomes to bedand I clutch a spar, a barrel, an oar,and ride out the night with it. When He fucks mestill He doesn’t speak, for speech is creationbut I rock with him, I roll insidewhat cannot be comprehended, in force. I forgetthat I’m a man, I forget the wild sea, I let slipmy grasp and the colors I havethat cover me. Once I dreamedof the morning: we left the house togetherin identical sober suits, we stood in the streetand beheld the sad little town, wreathed in black crepefor its children. As though the morningcould show me His face. He coughed.And when I awokein our ordinary bed, streaked by sun through leaded windows, I heldmy baby to my breast and watched the roof  beamand whispered to her, It’s all right,we are safe only and always from our dreams.
