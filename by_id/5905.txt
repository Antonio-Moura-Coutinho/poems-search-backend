The man’s uniform was bluewith a brown insignia of a spider on his righttop pocket that she saw he kept unbuttoned.As he waltzed down the path to the gatethe Siamese cat that frequented the gardenraised its back and hissed. The man laughedand flounced out to his waiting white van.Oh, the shit-faced side streets of life! OK,she’d been born in Madras, in a flowery tea shopwhile an albino conjurer magicked a hareto leap from his heavily-ringed brown fingers.Five yellow roses? Enough to encourage herto cook saffron rice, with turmeric-tinged prawnsand sautéed yellow courgettes. She didn’t playthe Ry Cooder where yellow roses say goodbye.
