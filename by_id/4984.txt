
After it came in like a dark birdOut of the snow, barely whistlingThe notes father, mother, child,It was hard to say what made us happiest. Seeing the branches where it had learnedTo stir the air? The air that openedWithout fear? Just the branchesAnd us in a room of wild things? Like a shapeless flame, it flewA dozen times around the room.And, in a wink, a dozen more.Into the wall, the window, the door. You said the world turns to parts.You said the parts are cunning spheres.You said you always love the face of sin.You said itâ€™s here, the lips and eyes and skin. Outside the snow deepenedWith heaves of discontent.Inside, the tremor of our lifeFlew in and in and in.
