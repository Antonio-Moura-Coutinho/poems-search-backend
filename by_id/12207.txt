
The ugly duckling remained uglyits whole life but found othersas ugly as itself, I guess that’s the message.Smoke rises from the heads in the backyard.Do you think if I hang around here long enoughsomeone will proffer a muffin, one skulking shadow to another?Soon, my shoes will be part of the populous dirt.Have I learned all the wrong lessons,the ones you shouldn’t know untilthe last dew-clogged lawn is mowedand the sun goes down on the ruined battlements?Why was I given a toy train if notto stage stupendous wrecks? Sure,I can walk by the sea holding a handwith as much melancholy as the next fellow,substituting the cries of slammed wavesfor the droll adumbrations of distraughtskeletons, the day taking on the sheenof a stone removed from the mouthand skipped between the breakers jubilant and sunk.
