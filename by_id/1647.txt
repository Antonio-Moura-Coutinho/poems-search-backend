
I don’t know. I still can’t get it right, the way those dirt roads cut across the flatsand led to shacks where hounds and muddy shoatsskulked roundabouts. Describing it sounds triteas hell, the good old South I love to hate.The truth? What’s that? How should I know?I stayed inside too much. I learned to boastof stupid things. I kept my ears shut tight,as we kept doors locked, windows locked,the curtains drawn. Now I know why. The dark could hide things from us. Dark could seewhat we could not. Sometimes those dirt roads shockedme, where they ended up: I watched a dog diein the ditch. The man who shot him winked at me.
