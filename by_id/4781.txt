
The fire was so fierce, So red, so gray, so yellowThat, along with the land,It burned part of the skyWhich stayed black in that corner For years,As if it were night thereEven in the daytime, A piece of the sky burntAnd which then Could not be counted onEven by the birds.It was a regular fire—Terrible—we forget thisAbout fire—terribleAnd full of pride.  It intended to beBig, no regular fire.  Like so many of us,It intended to be moreAnd this time was.It was not better or worseThan any other fireGrowing up.  But this time, it was a fireAt just the right time And in just the right place—If you think like a fire—A place it could do something big.Its flames reached outWith ten thousand pincers, As if the fireWere made of beetles and scorpionsClawing themselves to get up,Pinching the air itselfAnd climbing, So many sharp animalsOn each other’s backsThen into the air itself, Ten thousand snaps and pinchesAt least,So that if the sky Was made of something,It could not get away this time.Finally the fire Caught the sky,Which acted like a slow rabbit Which had made a miscalculation.It didn’t believe this could happen And so it ran left,Right into the thin toothpicks of flames,Too fast to pull back,The sky with all its arms,Hands, fingers, fingernails,All of itDisappeared.  Goodbye.The sky stayed blackFor several years after.I wanted to tell youThis small storyAbout the sky.It’s a good oneAnd explains why the skyComes so slowly in the morning,Still unsure of what’s here.  But the story is not mine.It was written by fire,That same small fireThat wanted to come homeWith something of its ownTo tell,And it did,A small piece of blue in its mouth.
