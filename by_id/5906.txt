
the lonely Incorporating the words of L.S. Lowry I used to paint the sea, but never a shore,and nobody was sailing on it. It wasn’t eventhe sea, it was just my own loneliness.It’s all there, you know. It’s all in the sea.The battle is there, the inevitability of it all,the purpose. When I switched to peoplethey were all lonely. Crowds are theloneliest thing of all, I say. Every individualin them is a stranger to everyone else.I would stand for hours in one spotand scores of little kids who hadn’t hada wash for weeks would group round me.Had I not been lonely, none of my workwould have happened. I should not havedone what I’ve done, or seen what I’ve seen.There’s something grotesque in me and Ican’t help it. I’m drawn to others who arelike that. They’re very real people. It’s justI’m attracted to sadness and there are somevery sad things. These people are ghostlyfigures. They’re my mood, they’re myself.Lately, I started a big self-portrait. I thoughtI won’t want this thing, no one will, soI went and turned it into a grotesque head.memo to lowry  You’re right, there are grotesques who shine a dark light that lures us like how the sirens tried to lure Odysseus, and yes, maybe we ourselves are among the grotesques, but there are also the beautiful who, if we’re lucky, save us from ourselves, and validate the sun’s light, and maybe also the moon’s.
