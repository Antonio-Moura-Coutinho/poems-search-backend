
When I remember plain heroic strengthAnd shining virtue shown by Ypres pools,Then read the blither written by knaves for foolsIn praise of English soldiers lying at length,Who purely dream what England shall be madeGloriously new, free of the old stainsBy us, who pay the price that must be paid,Will freeze all winter over Ypres plains.Our silly dreams of peace you put asideAnd brotherhood of man, for you will seeAn armed mistress, braggart of the tide,Her children slaves, under your mastery.We'll have a word there too, and forge a knife,Will cut the cancer threatens England's life.
