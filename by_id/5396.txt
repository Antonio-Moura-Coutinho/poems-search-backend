My undefiled is not herselftonight, but one thing’s forever:I just saw the video explainingthe neighborhood applause,a book of anthems where sirensplunge into the gold of the initialsat that karaoke party for her boyfriend. We cooked up all the goodies and faunscome through the windows.That’s her thing.“I like this path to darkness”she keeps saying.Whatever party fame's doing to herchances for a quick trial. Barbarella can’t touch her Goldilocks.That dog don't birdfor she coming back or not.
