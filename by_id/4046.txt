
Because the butterfly’s yellow wingflickering in black mud
was a wordstranded by its language.
Because no one elsewas coming — & I ran
out of reasons.So I gathered fistfuls
of  ash, dark as ink,hammered theminto marrow, into
a skull thickenough to keepthe gentle curse
of  dreams. Yes, I aimedfor mercy — 
but came only closeas building a cage
around the heart. Shuttersover the eyes. Yes,I gave it hands
despite knowingthat to stretch that clay slabinto five blades of light,I would go
too far. Because I, too,needed a place
to hold me. So I dippedmy fingers back
into the fire, pried openthe lower faceuntil the wound widened
into a throat,until every leaf shook silverwith that god
-awful scream& I was done.
& it was human.
