
If Socrates drank his portion of hemlock willingly,if the Appalachians have endured unending ages of erosion,if the wind can learn to read our minds and moonlight moonlight as a master pickpocket,surely we can contend with contentment as our commission.Deer in a stubble field, small birds dreamingunimaginable dreams in hollow trees,even the icicles, darling, even the icicles shame uswith their stoicism, their radiant resolve. Listen to me now: think of something you love but not too dearly, so the night will steal from usonly what we can afford to lose.
