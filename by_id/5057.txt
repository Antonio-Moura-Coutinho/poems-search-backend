Bills to pay, pain to obliterate,a favor to a friend desperate for more time before facing facts,or a reason less beholden to One-day-at-a-time or I-don’t-know-why or There-is-no-why-I-just-like-getting-high or Then-Jesus-spoke-to-meblather. Nothing’s enough, not even the moments when her voice — any voice, my voice —vanishes into the Voice the hymnwrenches from the throats of the spiritualpaupers up there swaying in black satin.The God of the Garden is the Godof Chemistry, too, a single sniffin a lifetime proof enough — nothingcan slough errands or heartbreakso fast into the metaphysical ditch where all of it belongs. Weren’t we made for better than the Fall, if Fall this is? We all see what the Flood keeps doing.A little while dry, please, a little whilewith no chattering chimp betweenthe ears & the Wizard once more in Oz.This is my mind, not hers. She’s a story I heard. I’m a story I can’t stop hearing. A plastic tarp in a monsoon may beher future. A plush ride home to havoc.A vision that delivers her from want,deserving or not.
