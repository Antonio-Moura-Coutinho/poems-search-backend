
Kitty Goes Kommando and the Goldman Rats — Phooey!That blue scaffolding holds up the sky. Who did we thinkwe were padlocking in, or out? Give me that hugelooping black script no one can read, a secret glyph,and just where someone has smashed the window, Jesusthe Way the Truth the Life and a dented aluminum frame.He bent down, we know, and wrote something illegible on the ground.A toothy black-and-white dinosaur gapes. I like the crackin this wall of monsters where skylines topple and ogrestwiddle train tracks in their claws like pipe cleaners.Down the long, semi-abandoned street in Queenscalligraphy gallops toward the shop displaying,like guitar strings, seven different iron rodsfor gates. Hole in the wall, rose sound-hole,ribbed sounding board — always from fissures and gapsmelody strains as trains thunderclank acrossthe girdered overpass, a siren keens, and a solitary manambles past amputated acacias fisting out with leaves.
