
An old man on Grace Street is going madIn a Canadian T-shirt he won’t changeAnd red unwrinkling pants I thought had madeHim stylish when I met him in the spring —Five or six times a day I see him walkDown Grace Street to St. Francis church, and knockAnd pull its wooden doors, always shockedThat his entitled holy place is locked. Undreams Damascus from a baffled Paul,Rolls back the road where some unstricken SaulRises up, as bubbles through a beerTo a surface where we disappear And wake in some uncalendared forever,An unwelcome Elijah passing over.
