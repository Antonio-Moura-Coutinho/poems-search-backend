Springing JackGreen wooden leaves clap light away,Severely practical, as theyShelter the children candy-pale,The chestnut-candles flicker, fail . . .The showman’s face is cubed clear asThe shapes reflected in a glassOf water—(glog, glut, a ghost’s speechFumbling for space from each to each).The fusty showman fumbles, must Fit in a particle of dustThe universe, for fear it gainIts freedom from my cube of brain.Yet dust bears seeds that grow to graceBehind my crude-striped wooden faceAs I, a puppet tinsel-pinkLeap on my springs, learn how to think—Till like the trembling golden stalkOf some long-petalled star, I walkThrough the dark heavens, and the dewFalls on my eyes and sense thrills through.     II. The Ape Watches “Aunt Sally”The apples are an angel’s meat;The shining dark leaves make clear sweetThe juice; green wooden fruits alwayFall on these flowers as white as day—(Clear angel-face on hairy stalk:Soul grown from flesh, an ape’s young talk!)And in this green and lovely groundThe Fair, world-like, turns round and roundAnd bumpkins throw their pence to shedAunt Sally’s wooden clear-striped head.—I do not care if men should throwRound sun and moon to make me go—As bright as gold and silver pence . . .They cannot drive their black shade hence!
