
Wandered tonight through a cityas ruined as a body with brokenribs and a bared heart. Looked for you there with cookies in my pocket, searched for a sigh, for movement in demolished streets and alleys. Tonightsince Iâ€™d forgotten for a moment where you are,I searched for you with hope in my bones.But no matter how I lured you with my voiceand my eyes, walls of debris grew up steadily around you, cellars seemedto creep around you. I remained alonewith those cookies in my pocketand kept calling and walking.
