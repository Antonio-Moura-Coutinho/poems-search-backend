
the difference between a cigarette holder    and cigarette case,the pleasure of a lorgnette over spectacles,    of a fortnight overtwo weeks, of a spiral over graduated stairs,    of the frisson of cryinglike pouty boys, and of the way to walk a lobster    on a leash: drag it,its exoskeleton rapping on the cobbles    through the rabbleof Montparnasse, as if lugging luggage.    We did what could notgain us a week of rent or even a plate of fish,    yet we managed to eatsickening amounts, to hate on our patroness,    the Princess de Polignac,though, and I am sorry, she had bought us wine.    Once, in the chamberbefore an evening concert, I hid a sack of bees    in the white baby grand,and when ball-gowned Polignac raised the leaf    they swarmed through the stringsto the chandelier and the Princess saw a living sun    and felt a little less drearyand a little less proud of being bored.
