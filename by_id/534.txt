
Someone is looking for us.
I sensed it earlier at the creek
while floating on my back, and again
on Route 8 near Brookline.
So we’ve detoured to this hillside
eroding and crazy with markers.
We’re looking for row mm or nn
or something like that.
I lug the baby; my wife runs ahead.
This neighborhood knows her–
she passes so easily between stones.
She finds the grave, her father
dead ten years now. In the time it takes
to say kaddish the sun’s dropped.
I set down my son
and he crawls in the dimness,
pulling himself up on the headstone.
How delicately he fingers the marble.
Quickly he rounds its corner. Vanishes.
I’m thinking: grass, stone, quiet–
then babbling from another world.
