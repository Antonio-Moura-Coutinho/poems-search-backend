
There is so much sweetness in children’s voices,And so much discontent at the end of day,And so much satisfaction when a train goes by.I don’t know why the rooster keeps crying,Nor why elephants keep raising their trunks,Nor why Hawthorne kept hearing trains at night.A handsome child is a gift from God,And a friend is a vein in the back of the hand,And a wound is an inheritance from the wind.Some say we are living at the end of time,But I believe a thousand pagan ministersWill arrive tomorrow to baptize the wind.There’s nothing we need to do about John. The BaptistHas been laying his hands on earth for so longThat the well water is sweet for a hundred miles.It’s all right if we don’t know what the roosterIs saying in the middle of the night, nor why we feelSo much satisfaction when a train goes by.
