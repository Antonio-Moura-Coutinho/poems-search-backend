But you made everynecklace clasp.But you made themcaress the napelike an errant windafter a shower. But you made everyeyelash erotic. Everysingle strand of hairsoft.But you made themfrom dust & bone.Made every glorious singing thigh. Everybutton nose.But you made themwith holesâ€”wide opento the faintest hintsof saltin a sea breeze, saltin the sweaty mouthof a navel, saltin the blood, sweetin every wrong way.
