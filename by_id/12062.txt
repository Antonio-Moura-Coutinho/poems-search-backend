The blackbird sings atthe frontier of his music.The branch where he satmarks the brink of doubt,is the outpost of his realm,edge from which to routencroachers with trillsand melismatic runs sur-passing earthbound skills.It sounds like ardor,it sounds like joy. We are gladhere at the borderwhere he signs the airwith his invisible staves,“Trespassers beware”—Song as survival—a kind of pure music whichwe cannot rival.
