
What is mysterious about loss, flush of arm pulled from a wilted sleeve,summer’s urine-tang in autumn leaves?Let   John Keats light another fag.Or Brontë refuse the doctoron her black sateen settee.For whatever part of   you may be taken away, you said,is the scar I will visit firstwith my mouth, each time, as gold visits the thieved till, sun the obliterated sill, saying praise you for leavingme this you, this living still.
