
O darling, the moon did not disrobe you.You fell asleep that way, nudeand capsized by our wine, our Bump‘n’ Grind shenanigans. Blame iton whatever you like; my bed welcomes whomever you decide to be: thug-mistress, poinsettia, John Doe in the alcove of my dreams. Youcan quote verbatim an entire albumof Bone Thugs-n-Harmonywith your ass in the air. There’s nothingwrong with that. They mince syllablesas you call me yours. You don’t like me but still invite me to your homewhen your homies aren’t nearenough to hear us crash into each other like hours. Some men have killed their lovers because they loved themso much in secret that the secret kept coming out: wife gouging her husband with suspicion, churches sneeringwhen an usher enters. Never mind that.The sickle moon turns the sky into a man’s mouth slapped sideways to keep him from spilling what no one wouldunderstand: you call me God when it gets good though I do not exist to you outside this room. Be yourself or no one else here. Your do-rag is camouflage-patterned and stuffed into my mouth.
