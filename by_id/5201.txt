
Turning to watch you leave,I see we must always walk towardother loves, river of   heavenbetween two office buildings. Orphaned cloud, fish soup poppling,book spined in the open palm. Unstoppable light.I think it is all right.Or do tonight, garden toada speaking stone,young sound in an old heart.Annul the self? I float it,a day lily in my wine. Oblivion?I love our lives,keeping me from it.
