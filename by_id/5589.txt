The men’scountry was still captive, their greatIndies had seen them ousted,their slaves from centuries backwere still black, and their queenwas in English exile.The only ripostes still opento them were torpedoesand their throaty half-American-sounding language.Speaking a luckier one we set off home then. Homeand all that word would meanin the age of rebirthing nationswhich would be my time.
