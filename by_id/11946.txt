
I remember Tony arguing in front of his mirrors, the soldierswere painting the trees, Tony saton the floor of white hair, and all the trees werepainted white. And he spat at Alfonso’s irony, but whenthey played accordion, the fourth among us had no name.“I am not sleeping with Tony! He simply cuts my hair!”—but our dinner is a tiny blue fish and, with my lean brother-in-law,we are playing cards. I pull spade after spade after spade butthis skinny sparrow, this barber no simple soul, takes mewith his fingers by my nose and kisses me, quickly, on the lips!When Tony washed my hair, when Alfonsokissed between my toes, when my lipstrembled, when the fourth one laughed, when Tony slept, slept in the earth,on the empty streets of our district, a bit of windcalled for the life which no one knew, a lifewhich daily took all of us: my neighbortaken, his wife taken, their apartment quiet.I say this slowly, as if unaffected:their apartment quiet, on the floor, dirty water from their boots.
