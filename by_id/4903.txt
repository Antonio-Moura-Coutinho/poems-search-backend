Rage is your slow practiceThat makes of every day another dayIn whose gathering promise the shy sparrowsShiver instead of sing. I want to go away.See these footsteps? These black shapes in the snow?If there is a word for them, it’s no word I know. Pursuit?, no. Proof?, no. Don’t call it fear.Could I cross this white sheet if I were coward,Edge to edge, margin to margin, neverReferring to anything outside itself?—Stop that. Stop pointing to the photo on the shelf.
