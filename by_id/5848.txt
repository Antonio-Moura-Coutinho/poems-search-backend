
Here, I am blowing this little streamof blue vapor into your parted lips.Here, I am placing my hands on your chestin an X while my red nails distractthe crowd of impostor lifeguardsclosing in. Here is the place to raisethe tent, I can feel it in my bones.The snake has perfected his skin, he isready to be lifted and passed. Howdid I do it? The process was messy,I’d rather not share it, but look, lookat us now. Lemon drops and cherry bombs.It’s the eye of the tiger, went the songI used to sing in the basement alone.
