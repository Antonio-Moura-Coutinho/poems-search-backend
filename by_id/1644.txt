Before he leaves for home, we ask if he’d like a Jewish blessing.Our grandson’s handsome face ignites;he chirps a rousing, yes, for a long life.We unfold the prayer shawl,its Hebrew letters silvering the spring light,hold the white tallis above his head,recite the blessing in its ancient languageand then the English, adding, for a long life.Isaac complains, the tallis didn’ttouch his head, so he didn’t feel the blessing.We lower its silken ceilingto graze his dark hair,repeat the prayer.
