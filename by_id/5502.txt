Light hummedthe holes like yellow jackets. My mouthwas a nest torn empty.Then, he was at the table.Then, in the pig’s jaws — he was not hungry. He was stop.He was bad apple. He was choking.So I punched my fists against his stomach.Mars flew outand broke open or bloomed — how many small red eyes shut in that husk?He said, Look. Look. And they did.He said, Lift up your shirt. And I did.He slid his fork beneath my ribs — Yes, he sang. A Jesus side wound.It wouldn’t stop bleeding.He reached insideand turned on the lamp — I never knew I was also a lamp — until the lightfell out of me, dripped down my thigh, flew up in me,caught in my throat like a canary.Canaries really means dogs, he said.He put on his shoes.You started this with your mouth, he pointed.Where are you going? I asked.To ride the Ferris wheel, he answered,and climbed inside me like a window.
