Finding two dogs in his house one night, he slammed his door to trap them, gathered stones and — the flinging done —  gibbeted the bodies from a tree. A week later, he woke in darkness, feelinghimself swept down a black, stinking holethe way in Kansas City, Missouri,Inspector Daniel Collins, smacked by a surgeof sewer-water, slipped from his safety line and clattered down a 28-inch pipe dark as the grave it seemed about to be. Waking from sound sleep that morning, wolfing a breakfast of high-fibertoast and raisin bran, Dan never dreameda real nightmare would swallow him.Selvakumar — squeezed by his nightmare — screamed. One ear was deaf; both hands were numb; his legs, too weak to hold his weight, tongue lolling like a dead fish in his mouth the way Dan’s did as liquid filth shoved his head under,while — first thrashing and battering,then not — he rolled/banged/slitheredthrough earth’s bowels in darkness worsethan what seized Irmgard Holm’s left eye when, after cataract surgery, she groped for eye drops in the night, grabbed a Super Glue tube, and sealed her lid tight. Doctors took Selvakumar’s cash, and shooktheir heads. A village healer diagnosed,“The dogs cursed you.” To break the curse,friends caught a stray, named her Selvi — Repentance — wrapped her in an orange sari, and hung a purple garland on her neck. Selvakumar — all in white, but for a purple garland like his bride’s — felt his dead legs quiver as she edged toward him.Even as he pledged eternal love, he plannedto wed a woman when his health returned.Unlike a two-legged wife, though, Selvi didn’thound him about the marital act, didn’t demand a better sari or a bigger home, or nag as he grew more helpless every day. Easy to laugh, invoking Brad & Angelina, Pyramus & Thisbe. Still, on the nightSelvakumar found himself rushing againdown the dark hole, who can say that Selvididn’t guide him — as Irmgard’s husbandled her to the doctor who dissolved the glue and saved her eye — as Daniel’s cries led rescuers to him, twelve feet underground, two miles from where he began —  as the son of Marjorie Potts Gaffrey(dead in her sleep at 99), by sprinklinghis mother’s ashes in her favorite flower pot, led Marjorie to wake as an African violet,sun bright on her leaves as it was in Daniel’s and Irmgard’s eyes, the dew of morning like the feel, as Selvakumar lay dying in his bed, of Selvi’s tongue.
