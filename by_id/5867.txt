Does everyone pretend, part of aliveI am proposing words — All structures have crumbled in earliest death. I’m crossing the yellow sandsIt’s so hard to know without relating it, to youshaping a heart, take hold of me and someone saysI don’t get it! You don’t have to have love,or you do, which? I don’t think you do; beforethe explosion? I was here without it and have been inmany places loveless. I don’t want youto know what I’m really thinking or do I, beforecreation when there might be no “I knew”Everything one’s ever said not quite true. He or she be-trays you; why you want to hurt me ... badWant to, or just do? Treason was provokedeverywhere even here, by knowing one was one andI was alone, a pale hue. The sky of deathis milky green today, like a poison pool near adesert mine. Picked prickly pear fruit and Itasted it, then we drove on, maybe to Yarnell.These outposts where I grew up; I didn’t do thatI have no ... identity, and the love is an objectto kick as you walk on the blazing bare ground, where ...    sentimental, when what I love, I ... don’t have that oneword. This fire all there is ... to find ... I find itYou have to find it. It isn’t love, it’s what?
