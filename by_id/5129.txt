I call it “horseophthalmology,” because it is a different kind of system—not celestial, necessarily, but vision in which the small,the wispy, the lightly lifted or stirring threads of existenceexcite more fear than louder and larger bodies do. It’s Matthewwho said that the light of the body is the eye, and that ifthe eye is healthy the whole body will be full of light. Maybein this case “light” can also mean “lightness.” With my eyes ofcorrupted and corruptible flesh I’m afraid I see mostly darknessby which I mean heaviness. How great is that darkness? Not as great as the inner weightlessness of horses whose eyes perceive, correctly I believe, the threat of annihilation in every windblown dust mote of malignant life. All these years I’ve been watching out warily in obvious places (in bars, in wars, in night cities andnightmares, on furious seas). Yet what’s been trying to destroy me has lain hidden inside friendly-seeming breezes, behind soft music, beneath the carpet of small things one can barely see. The eye is also a lamp, says Matthew, a giver of light, bestower of incandescent honey, which I will pour more cautiously over the courses I travel from now on. What’s that whisper? Just the delicate sweeping away of somebody’s life.
