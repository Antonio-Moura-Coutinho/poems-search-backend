At least snailshave shells, but all these have is—nothing.Small black antennae like fat pins waveas if they could take in enough to get them through.Turn them over, they’re the soles of new shoes,pale and unmarked as babies. They flow,the soil itself learning how to move and, moving,almost staying still, their silver monorailthe only evidence of where they’d been.And they die quiet, or at least (thankfully)out of the human ear’s range, between two stones,under heels, shriveling in salt or piss, at the tipsof sharp sticks. Fight back, I hear myself say,do something. Don’t just take it. But they dieas they had lived, exuding slime, likethe smaller boys, who’d juststand there, miserable in short pants,school socks down to their ankles,school tie unknotted and askew, and flowingfrom noses slow cauls of snot thatfrom time to time they’d lick or sniff back uppart way, until it flowed again, coatingthe upper lip, falling into the mouth, mixingwith tears before anything had been done,the fear itself enough, so even if we wantedwe couldn’t let them off. Sometimes it wasthe knee “where you daren’t show your mother,”other times the kick in the shins, the stick overthe head, the punch in the mouth, while theyjust stood there, or double up, gaspingfor breath, and we did it again.
