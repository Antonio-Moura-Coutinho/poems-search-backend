Her story is a part of something larger, it is a part
of history. No, her story is an illumination
of history, the matchstick lit in the black seam of time.
Or, no, her story is separate
from the whole, as distinct as each person is distinct
from the stream of people that led
to the one and leads past the one. Or, her story
is surrounded by history, the ambient spaciousness
of which she is the momentary foreground.
Maybe history is a net through which
just about everything passes, and the pieces of her
story are particles caught in the interstices.
Or, her story is a contradiction, something ordinary
that has no part in history at all, if history is
about what is included, what is made important.
History is the galleon in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, swaying like a drunk who will take
six months to finally reach his house.
She is on another ship, centuries later, on a journey
eastward that will take weeks across the same ocean.
The war is over, though her husband
is still in his officer’s uniform, small but confident
among the tall white officers. Her hair
is marcelled like a movie star’s waves,
though she has been too sick with the water’s motion
to know that anyone sees her. Her daughter is two,
the blur of need at the center of each day’s
incessant rocking. Here is a ship, an ocean.
Here is a figure, her story a few words in the blue void.

Research is mourning, my friend says. Which means what,
exactly, for the things listed in the archives
as filling the galleons when they left Cebu and Manila — 
ivory objects, jade objects, copper objects,
brass objects, lacquer objects, mother-of-pearl inlaid furniture,
pearls, rubies, sapphires, bolts of cotton cloth,
silks and gauzes, crepes and velvets, taffetas
and damasks and brocades, stockings, cloaks, robes,
kimonos, bed coverings, tapestries, linens, church
vestments, rugs, blue-and-white porcelain that numbered 1,500
in one ship, wax, tallow candles, cordage,
sailcloth, musk, borax, camphor, cigars, varieties of tea,
cinnamon that was dried and powdered, 40,000 pounds of it
listed in one ship’s manifest, cloves, pepper,
nutmeg, tamarind, ginger, martaban jars from Burma,
dragon jars from China, Vietnamese jars,
Siamese jars, Spanish jars, 800 jars found with the wreck
of one salvaged ship, jars that would have
contained tar for caulking, oil, wine, bizcocho bread,
salted meats, dried fruits, lard, bacon, beans, chickpeas, lentils,
flour, garlic, cheese, honey, rice, salt,
sugar, food for months, not enough food, not enough water,
chickens, cows, pigs, up to one thousand souls
depending on whether the ship had a tonnage of 300 or 500
or 1,000 or 2,000, ships that in the 250 years
of the trade route wrecked somewhere along the way
more often than they arrived in Acapulco, sailors,
mercenaries, officers, noblemen and their entourages, priests
and missionaries, slaves that were called indios
or chinos, nails, tools, iron cask hoops, fireworks, opals — elegy?

In Madrid I orient myself     I walk on the wide boulevards
and know an empire is its boulevards     I stand below the angel
skeptical of the beauty of angels     at the royal gardens I count
the 138 kinds of dahlias     at the crystal palace I imagine
the exhibition of plants indigenous to my islands     I walk
up the street of the poets     read the bronze lines on the ground
the longing and song of the pirate     in one museum I stare
at Picasso’s lightbulb     in the oldest neighborhoods
I wonder if  José Rizal walked these streets     studying diseases
of the eye during the day     writing his novel in the night
in another museum I look     at the paintings of the dwarves
of  the horses     of  the undying fruit     in the train station
I visit the memorial for the murdered     in the great white
square at dawn I walk     inscribe myself  like letters on a page
at the naval museum I look into the face of  Magellan     show the
painting my face     I sing the neighborhoods of Huertas
and Chueca     maybe only in Madrid     is the light a gold
weight always     at the supermarket I overhear     two Filipinos
speaking and I turn away and break     I find myself in
the cathedral     in the movie theater     where I watch a movie
without understanding the words spoken     around a corner
I stop because a kind of meadow     has been grown on the side
of a building     like a tallness of heart     a dream carried
into waking     my life breathing before it     incredible and true
