I let the knifeof wind inside and sing A Whiter Shade of Pale,no earthly reason why, and think of whatwon’t be and who, and whether it bespeed, wind, song, or my mind’s roarthat drowns for once time’s slangy whine,here comes hope to climb clear of before;stillborn hope with desperate, Moro-reflex, undead grip climbs right back up my neck, raising each pointless, residual nape hair in ancestral salute to an absence, to the airthat won’t question itself, won’t ever checkthe moral rearview. I accelerate gamely,wondering what makes me want to leaveeach person, place and thing I learn to love.What shoves me off again, racing insanely,as if to the place that will always savea place for me, a room that will containthe kind of people who’d embrace the things I’m still afraid I’m still afraid to face.
