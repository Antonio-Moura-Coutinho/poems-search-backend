Kings used to catch themat summer’s end, knife-blind them so that in their darknessthey’d feast on millet all day, all night, a break from beetles and seeds,until they grew from one ounce to four. Drownedin Armagnac, plucked, placed in a saucepan, roasted,you eat them whole, so the head dangles between your lips,crunch bones like hazelnuts, underneath the linen napkinyou must place over your head to create a scent tentor, so God won’t see your shame.

Mediterranean salt emerges as flight burstsin your mouth. Imagine yourself a memory, a body fullof meal, as Mitterrand must have, eating ortolanseight days before dying, his last illegal act. Fifteen minutesof savoring a supple, burning ball of fat until you exhaustits roast juices. When you finally swallow, you will regretthe end of a sensual experience. At least once in your life,you must pay the price for this princely folly.
