It rests on the headlike a bird nest, woven of twigs and tinseland awkward as soon as one stops to look.That pile of fallen leaves drifting fromthe brain to the fingertip burned on the stove, to the grooves in that man’s voice as he coos to his dog, blowing into the leaves of books with moonlit opossumsand Chevrolets easing down the roads of one’s bones. And now it plucks a single tulip from the pixelated blizzard: yet itself is a swarm, a pulse with noindigenous form, the brain’s lunar halo. Our compacted galaxy, its constellations trembling like flies caught in a spider web, until we die, and then the fliesbuzz away—while another accidental coherence counts to three to pass the time or notes the berries on the bittersweet vinestrewn in the spruces, red pebbles droppedin the brain’s gray pool. How it folds itself like a map to fit in a pocket, how it unfolds a fraying map from the pocket of the day.
