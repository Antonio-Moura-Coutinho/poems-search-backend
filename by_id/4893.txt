
When you show yourself to the woman you love, you don’t know your fearis not fear, itself. You have never been good,but now you are so good,who are you? Is it the liquidity of her skinthat bathes the world for you,or her face, captured like a she-lionin your own flesh?This summerbed is soft with ring upon ring upon ring of wedding, the kindthat doesn’t clink upon contact, the kindwith no contract,the kind in which the gold is only (only!) light. Cloud covers and lifts, and sleep and night and soon enough, love’sbig fire laughs at a terrible burn, but only (only!) because pain absorbs excess joy and you shouldn’t flaunt your treasures in front of all day’s eyes.
