
Fair tree! for thy delightful shade'Tis just that some return be made;Sure some return is due from meTo thy cool shadows, and to thee.When thou to birds dost shelter give,Thou music dost from them receive;If travellers beneath thee stayTill storms have worn themselves away,That time in praising thee they spendAnd thy protecting pow'r commend.The shepherd here, from scorching freed,Tunes to thy dancing leaves his reed;Whilst his lov'd nymph, in thanks, bestowsHer flow'ry chaplets on thy boughs.Shall I then only silent be,And no return be made by me?No; let this wish upon thee wait,And still to flourish be thy fate.To future ages may'st thou standUntouch'd by the rash workman's hand,Till that large stock of sap is spent,Which gives thy summer's ornament;Till the fierce winds, that vainly striveTo shock thy greatness whilst alive,Shall on thy lifeless hour attend,Prevent the axe, and grace thy end;Their scatter'd strength together callAnd to the clouds proclaim thy fall;Who then their ev'ning dews may spareWhen thou no longer art their care,But shalt, like ancient heroes, burn,And some bright hearth be made thy urn.
