
May the Babylonish curse,Strait confound my stammering verse,If I can a passage seeIn this word-perplexity,Or a fit expression find,Or a language to my mind,(Still the phrase is wide or scant)To take leave of thee, GREAT PLANT!Or in any terms relateHalf my love, or half my hate:For I hate, yet love, thee so,That, whichever thing I shew,The plain truth will seem to beA constrained hyperbole,And the passion to proceedMore from a mistress than a weed.Sooty retainer to the vine,Bacchus' black servant, negro fine;Sorcerer, that mak'st us dote uponThy begrimed complexion,And, for thy pernicious sake,More and greater oaths to breakThan reclaimed lovers take'Gainst women: thou thy siege dost layMuch too in the female way,While thou suck'st the laboring breathFaster than kisses or than death.Thou in such a cloud dost bind us,That our worst foes cannot find us,And ill fortune, that would thwart us,Shoots at rovers, shooting at us;While each man, thro' thy heightening steam,Does like a smoking Etna seem,And all about us does express(Fancy and wit in richest dress)A Sicilian fruitfulness.Thou through such a mist dost shew us,That our best friends do not know us,And, for those allowed features,Due to reasonable creatures,Liken'st us to fell Chimeras,Monsters that, who see us, fear usWorse than Cerberus or Geryon,Or, who first lov'd a cloud, Ixion.Bacchus we know, and we allowHis tipsy rites. But what art thou,That but by reflex can'st shewWhat his deity can do,As the false Egyptian spellAped the true Hebrew miracle?Some few vapours thou may'st raise,The weak brain may serve to amaze,But to the reigns and nobler heartCan'st nor life nor heat impart.Brother of Bacchus, later born,The old world was sure forlorn,Wanting thee, that aidest moreThe god's victories than beforeAll his panthers, and the brawlsOf his piping Bacchanals.These, as stale, we disallow,Or judge of thee meant - only thouHis true Indian conquest artAnd, for ivy round his dart,The reformed god now weavesA finer thyrsus of thy leaves.Scent to match thy rich perfumeChemic art did ne'er presumeThrough her quaint alembic strain,None so sov'reign to the brain.Nature, that did in thee excel,Fram'd again no second smell.Roses, violets, but toysFor the smaller sort of boys,Or for greener damsels meant;Thou art the only manly scent.Stinking'st of the stinking kind,Filth of the mouth and fog of the mind,Africa, that brags her foyson,Breeds no such prodigious poison,Henbane, nightshade, both together,Hemlock, aconite —Nay, rather, Plant divine, of rarest virtue;Blisters on the tongue would hurt you.'Twas but in a sort I blam'd thee;None e'er prosper'd who defam'd thee;Irony all, and feign'd abuse,Such as perplext lovers use,At a need, when, in despairTo paint forth their fairest fair,Or in part but to expressThat exceeding comelinessWhich their fancies doth so strike,They borrow language of dislike;And, instead of Dearest Miss,Jewel, Honey, Sweetheart, Bliss,And those forms of old admiring,Call her Cockatrice and Siren,Basilisk, and all that's evil,Witch, Hyena, Mermaid, Devil,Ethiop, Wench, and Blackamoor,Monkey, Ape, and twenty more;Friendly Trait'ress, loving Foe, —Not that she is truly so,But no other way they knowA contentment to express,Borders so upon excess,That they do not rightly wotWhether it be pain or not.Or, as men, constrained to partWith what's nearest to their heart,While their sorrow's at the height,Lose discrimination quite,And their hasty wrath let fall,To appease their frantic gall,On the darling thing whateverWhence they feel it death to sever,Though it be, as they, perforce,Guiltless of the sad divorce.For I must (nor let it grieve thee,Friendliest of plants, that I must) leave the.For thy sake, TOBACCO, IWould do any thing but die,And but seek to extend my daysLong enough to sing thy praise.But, as she, who once hath beenA king's consort, is a queenEver after, nor will bateAny tittle of her state,Though a widow, or divorced,So I, from thy converse forced,The old name and style retain,A right Katherine of Spain;And a seat, too, 'mongst the joysOf the blest Tobacco Boys;Where, though I, by sour physician,Am debarr'd the full fruitionOf thy favours, I may catchSome collateral sweets, and snatchSidelong odours, that give lifeLike glances from a neighbour's wife;And still live in the by-placesAnd the suburbs of thy graces;And in thy borders take delight,An unconquer'd Canaanite.
