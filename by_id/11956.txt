The moon’s pale-copper sphereRings—a gong too faint to hear—           Through the city.Let them linger, unawake.Down the mountain’s wrinkled brillianceDarkness empties like a lake.Minted gold, house windows make           Coins worth millions.Both in disbelief and prideAll the buildings in the distanceOn the river’s farther sideTake up, as the shadows slide,           New existence.Shadow slides along the roof,Past the guttering and gable,Shrinks, and leaves the house aloofWhere the light reads out its proof           Like a fable.
