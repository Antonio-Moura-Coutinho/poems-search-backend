No light can gild the sun god’s cheek but strainsthrough burlap now, Phoibos the refugee,his head a marble cabbage in a sackjouncing east by pickup down a dirt trackacross Seleucid wastes, Parthian plains,once more fortune’s tourist, bobbing free.Or not—just stashed behind a rubbish moundwhere bare-boned goats might crop a scraggy meal,scant miles from the museum’s shattered room.Stripped of laurels, his oracles, his loomof sacred strings, no Horai here spin round,just pacing men who wait to close the deal.A goatherd sings, slings a Kalashnikov:the godhead mute since looters hacked it off.
