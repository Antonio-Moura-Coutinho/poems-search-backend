
The light of evening, Lissadell,Great windows open to the south,Two girls in silk kimonos, bothBeautiful, one a gazelle.But a raving autumn shearsBlossom from the summer's wreath;The older is condemned to death,Pardoned, drags out lonely yearsConspiring among the ignorant.I know not what the younger dreams –Some vague Utopia – and she seems,When withered old and skeleton-gaunt,An image of such politics.Many a time I think to seekOne or the other out and speakOf that old Georgian mansion, mixPictures of the mind, recallThat table and the talk of youth,Two girls in silk kimonos, bothBeautiful, one a gazelle.Dear shadows, now you know it all,All the folly of a fightWith a common wrong or right.The innocent and the beautifulHave no enemy but time;Arise and bid me strike a matchAnd strike another till time catch;Should the conflagration climb,Run till all the sages know.We the great gazebo built,They convicted us of guilt;Bid me strike a match and blow.
