
Seated once by a brook, watching a childChiefly that paddled, I was thus beguiled.Mellow the blackbird sang and sharp the thrushNot far off in the oak and hazel brush,Unseen. There was a scent like honeycombFrom mugwort dull. And down upon the domeOf the stone the cart-horse kicks against so oftA butterfly alighted. From aloftHe took the heat of the sun, and from below.On the hot stone he perched contented so,As if never a cart would pass againThat way; as if I were the last of menAnd he the first of insects to have earthAnd sun together and to know their worth.I was divided between him and the gleam,The motion, and the voices, of the stream,The waters running frizzled over gravel,That never vanish and for ever travel.A grey flycatcher silent on a fenceAnd I sat as if we had been there sinceThe horseman and the horse lying beneathThe fir-tree-covered barrow on the heath,The horseman and the horse with silver shoes,Galloped the downs last. All that I could loseI lost. And then the child’s voice raised the dead.“No one’s been here before” was what she saidAnd what I felt, yet never should have foundA word for, while I gathered sight and sound.
