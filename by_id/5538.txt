I have a shovel.Can I turn it into a poem? On my stoveI’m boiling some milk thistle.I hope it will turn into a winged thesis before you stop reading. Look, I’m topless!Listen: approaching hooves!One drowned in a swimming pool.One removed his shoesand yearned off a bridge. One liveswith Alzheimer’s in a state facility, spittlein his white beard. Itturns out words are no help.But here I am with my shoveldigging like a foolbeside the spilth and sploshof the ungirdled sea. I can’t stop.The horses are coming, the thieves.I still haven’t found lasting love.I still want to hear violsin the little beach hotelthat’s torn down and gone.I want to see again the fishschooling and glittering like a veilwhere the waves shoveagainst the breakwater. Goneis the girl in her white sliptesting the chill with one bare foot.It’s too cold, but she goes in, socarefully, oh.
