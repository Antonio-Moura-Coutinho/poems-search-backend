
No longer interested in evil,the soul turns on its backat the watering hole, kicks its muscled legs.Everything goes neon pinkand green in the noonday sunwhen I press my thumbsto my little black eyes. My snout,wet with its own abundant grease,smells nothing of threat,of consequence. I put my handsbehind my head, I have nobidding to do. My feet go upon the desk, a woman appearsat my side. This is what I’ve earnedin Eden. The right to close my eyeswhen the camouflage trouserscome wading throughthe apple blossom’s slough —and the dream of myself as a babyemerging from the mortalbody, hoof by gleaming hoof.
