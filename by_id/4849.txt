Their antlers clambered wide,steep as the gorges.  As they fed, those branches twitched,sensory, delicate,yet when one buck rearedsquaring to look at ushis antlers and his gaze held suddenly motionless.               Further out, the skeleton.The tar paper it seemed to lie onwas hide.                Vertebrae like redwood stumps—an uneven heart-shaped cavern                   where a coccyx curled to its tip. Ribs fanned openhollow, emptied of organs.In the bushes its skull. Sockets and sinuses, mandible,its few small teeth.  All bare now except  that fur the red-brown color of a young boy’s head and also of wild iris stalks in winterstill clung to the drying scalp. Below the eye’s rim sagged               flat as a bicycle tire.The form was sinking away.The skin loosened, becoming other,shedding the mask that hidesbut must also reveal a creature.Off amid cliffs and hillssome unfleshed force roamed free. In the wind, I felt the half-life I watched watch me. Elk, I said, I see                you abandon this life, this earth—I stood for a time with the bones.
