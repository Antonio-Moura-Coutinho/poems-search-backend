
You find yourself in a narrow bed you’ve never slept in,on a tree-lined grassy field you’ve never walked upon,on a cold toilet seat you have not sat on,in a place you now call your home, your learning, your future.Red stone pathways expose the buildings that will housethe knowledge you seek,and the information you want to gather.You crane your neck to look upat the 13-story brick tower rising from the ground,looming over you as you walk past. The melodiesand beats of different songs mix,create a sound of their own,flow from open windows. Crushed leeksTop Ramen noodles ground into a blueand speckled carpet attract armies of antsto the communal kitchen on the sixth floor.You pull your jacket tighter against your body,strong, salty wind whips off the Sound,and up the hill as you walk throughRed Square toward the clatter of knives,forks and digesting bellies.Finally, you are released like a white dovefrom the hands of its owner, allowed to flydiscovering your dreams,discovering what you are made of.
