
I have no answer to the blank inequityof a four-year-old dying of cancer.I saw her on t.v. and weptwith my mouth full of meatloaf.I constantly flash on disasters now;red lights shout Warning. Danger.everywhere I look.I buckle him in, but what if a carwith a grille like a sharkbiteroared up out of the road?I feed him square mealsbut what if the fist of his heartshould simply fall open?I carried him safelyas long as I could,but now he's a runawayon the dangerous highway.Warning. Danger.I've started to pray.But the dangerous highwaycurves through blue eveningswhen I hold his yielding handand snip his miniscule nailswith my vicious-looking scissors.I carry him aroundlike an egg in a spoon,and I remember a porcelain fawn,a best friend's trust,my broken faith in myself.It's not my grace that keeps me erectas the sidewalk clatters downhillunder my rollerskate wheels. Sometimes I lie awaketroubled by this thought:It's not so simple to give a child birth;you also have to give it death,the jealous fairy's christening gift.I've always pictured my own deathas a closed door,a black room,a breathless leap from the mountain topwith time to throw out my arms, lift my head,and see, in the instant my heart stops,a whole galaxy of blue.I imagined I'd forget,in the cessation of feeling,while the guilt of my lifetime floated awaylike a nylon nightgown,and that I'd fall into clean, fresh forgiveness.Ah, but the death I've given awayis more mine than the one I've kept:from my hand the poisoned apple,from my bow the mistletoe dart.Then I think of Mama,her bountiful breasts.When I was a child, I really swear,Mama's kisses could heal.I remember her promise,and whisper it over my sweet son's sleep:    When you float to the bottom, child,    like a mote down a sunbeam,    you'll see me from a trillion miles away:    my eyes looking up to you,    my arms outstretched for you like night.
