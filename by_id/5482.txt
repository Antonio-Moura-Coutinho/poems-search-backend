
The rain is haunted;I had forgotten.My children are two hours abedAnd yet I riseHearing behind the typing of the rain,Its abacus and digits,A voice calling me again,Softer, clearer.The kids lie buried under duvets, soundAsleep. It isn’t them I hear, it’sSomething formless that fidgetsBeyond the window’s benighted mirror,Where a negative develops, where reflectionHolds up a glass of spirits.White noisePrecipitates.Rain is a kind of recollection.Much has been shed,Hissing indignantly into the ground.It is the listeningBelates,Haunted by these fingertaps and sighsBehind the beaded-curtain glistening,As though by choices that we didn’t make and never wanted,As though by the dead and misbegotten.
