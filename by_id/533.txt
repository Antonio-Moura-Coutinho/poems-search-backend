
My father was four years in the war,
and afterward, according to my mother,
had nothing to say. She says he trembled
in his sleep the next four years.
My father was twice the father of sons
miscarried, and afterward said nothing.
My mother keeps this silence also.
Four times my father was on strike,
and according to my mother; had nothing
to say. She says the company didnâ€™t understand,
nor can her son, the meaning
of an extra fifteen cents an hour in 1956
to a man tending a glass furnace in August.
 
I have always remembered him a tired man.
I have respected him like a guest
and expected nothing.
It is April now.
My life lies before me,
enticing as the woman at my side.
Now, in April, I want him to speak.
I want to stand against the worn body
of his pain. I want to try it on
like a coat that does not fit.
