In thatspirit, and bearing that intention within us, we note here, aselsewhere, there are generally three alternative courses. Theﬁrst is simply to accept without question an explanationsomeone in our proximity, and whom we know, proffers andthen elects to modify out of concern that small details areescaping to set up camp opposite what is being said. Thesecond is to surrender one’s reluctance to withdraw from thepresence of an unsolved problem by grabbing crudely atvacant affirmations that nothing further need be done, thateverything to be accomplished was accomplished well beforecurrent advocates approached the threshold, coaxed forwardby the desire to indulge their own vanity. The third is toremain absolutely uncommitted to any speciﬁc course, andto insist that the process begin anew each time, contendingthat no information will ever be adequate to the task ofjudgment, that the requirements, as they evolve, will makeeach element moot, or at a minimum place the likelihoodof resolution in ever greater doubt over time, with theparadoxical effect that the impulse to continue is notthereby diminished, only channeled into a narrower, moredetermined form. Although no beneﬁts are likely to accruefrom this last course, it’s unquestionably the one most oftenfollowed, owing perhaps to people’s need to test the strengthof a membrane designed to repel assault, or their perennialenchantment with kaleidoscopic complications spreadingover the earth, as time walks through the sky.
