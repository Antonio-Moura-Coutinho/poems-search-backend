We don’t knowwho concocted this one, where the triggerfishand clowns fade to inky neon dashes undera fisherman’s skiff. A few plastic pontoonsknock around makeshift slips. Dusk coaxesfrom the shore the small, dull chimeof a spoon against a pot. And TV voicesflash slow across a cliff where two pink loversin matching swimwear kiss their glassesat the edge of a blue pool built just low enoughinto the hill so the couple can gaze into the seaand think of infinity. Many, many years ago,a great emperor wiggled his fingerand commanded his army to corral all the lepersin his domain then pack them into a sailing shipto be delivered to the missions on this clusterof verdant volcanic rock. The emperor’s ordersto his captain were clear: if the monks refusedthe ship’s freight, the skipper was to simplydump the whole sick cargo far from any shore.Other incurables followed in lots over time,or trickled in, hiding from nearby tribes,or banished from other lands to live among theselush slopes of mahogany, papaya, and weeds.Two women, Filomena and Josefa, arrivedwithin days of one another. By then, each had lostmost their toes, though they had tenfull fingers between them, each womanwith one hand still intact. No one is surehow it began, but once a week the pairwould knock on the door of the scowlingMadre Clementina to borrow the hospital’sonly guitar, carved from jackfruit and crackedpretty bad along the back. To these women —no big deal, for Filomena once transcribed the early moonlight serenades of the horny friarsin the Royal South for the brats of an Andalusian duke. Josefa was the daughter of a carpenter, a maker of tables to be exact. She learned to play a harana’s tremulous melodies on her mother’s bandurria at the age of three. The pair of outcasts would stifle laughs, thrilled to earn the crusty nun’s grudging Yes, then amble out to low tide and find a flat rock to shareso they could prop the old guitar on both their laps, the one bad wrist of each woman unwrapped to their stumps, pulled for now behind their backs as they looked past the bay toward the violent waters that first carried them here. And they jammed. Filomena with the five deft hammers of her left and Josefa with her right,thick-muscled — both blue-veined and furious, scrubbing from the instrument all those wicked rhythms from Castile to Nowhere on a fragile scrap of furniture that could barely hold its tune. They sat shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh, their good hands brushing from time to time. What they couldn’t remember, they made up, and everything they made up disappeared over the lagoon and over the ocean, every note in every run, every lie and desire, every nick and crack in the jackfruit, the fat harmonics plucked from the old nun’s grunts, six taut strandsof gut whose chords skimmed the water like night locusts in bursts of low clouds and which bore everything in front of them and behind,the brine of the women’s necks mixed with the saltof the lagoon, the cliffs, the spoons, the bright nimbus of the West dipping like a noose, the future of pontoons and fake tits, the historyof nifty crowns pried loose of their jewels, the jiggle of a little finger gone still. One way to erase an island is to invent the watersthat surround it. You can name the watersthat will turn all the sounds the island makes into salt.It will teach you to listen to everything you love disappear    ...    or you can invent a song so big it will hold the entire ocean.  Josefa and Filomena rocked in the dark, hip to hip, joined by that third body of wood, which made sure there was nothing left in the unbroken world to possibly make them whole.
