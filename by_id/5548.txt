
This night nurse is different.She walks into my room and does not turn the light on.She thinks I am sleeping.I have just barely opened my left eye,am looking through the slightest slit,as moonlight exposes the roomfor what it really is — a collectionof surfaces; lines and planes, mostly.The night nurse puts a foot up on the radiatorand braces her clipboard on her kneeas she appears to take down a few notes.I imagine she is working on a sonnet,and that her ankle looks like polished walnut.You imagine she is working on a crossword,and that her feet are killing her.The slightest slit is like an old gateat a Japanese tea garden at night,in the rain, that is supposed to be closed,that is supposed to be locked.“Someone has locked up poorly,” you’d say.“Incorrectly.” But no one has asked you.
