
Spout of a leaf,listen out for the screamsof your relentless audience:the applause of a waterfallin the distance,a hurricane looting a Miami shopping mall.How careful you are with the rain-cradlingcurve of your back.Near your forest,all are ready to swimand happy to drownin me: this lake of firethat moats the edges. From my mouth,they come to peel the flames and drink their slick throatsinto the most silent of ashes.
