
It turns out there’s a difference between a detailand an image. If the dandelion on the sidewalk ismere detail, the dandelion inked on a friend’s bicepis an image because it moves when her body does,even when a shirt covers the little thorny black sunon a thin stalk. The same way that the bar codeon the back of another friend’s neck is just a detail,until you hear that the row of numbers underneathare the numbers his grandfather got on his armin a camp in Poland. Then it’s an image, somethingactivated in the reader’s senses beyond mere fact.I know the difference doesn’t matter, except in poetry,where a coffin is just another coffin until someoneat a funeral calls it a wooden overcoat, an imageso heavy and warm at the same time that you forgetit’s about death. At my uncle’s funeral, the coffinwas so beautiful it was like the chandelier lightingthe room where treaties are signed. It made me thinkof how loved he was. It made me think of Shoshonefunerals, where everything the dead person ownedwas put into a bonfire, even the horse. In that lastsentence, is the horse a detail or an image? I don’t really know. In my mind, a horse is never anywhere near a fire, and a detail is as luminous as an image.The trumpet vine on the sagging fence. The clothesin the fire. And each tattoo that I touch on your back:the three-part illustration of how to use chopsticks,the four-leaf clover, the clock face stopped at 12:05.
