
That this mountainside looks like a face is accidental,
which is a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.
The touch-smoothed redwood cross-section, in its rings
of growth and brightness,
seems like a sun seen from underwater,
wobbly as jelly, mocking my
inability to find a job, my food stamps,
and saddens me to see
the teens tagging themselves in nearby places
to earn a virtual friend's respect, or boasting
other symptoms of youth while leaving
their greasy fingerprints on the thick lenses of my glasses,
mocking my desire for artwork
to remain packed in straw, and in music
for sleepers halfway awake to grow wild in.
It all gives me faith in arranging, I guess,
when there is nothing else I seem much good at but fuss
and copy and paste, with a head full of so many other worries.
Got a check today. Bought a book I can't read
without it putting me to sleep
with its out-of-date luxuriousness.
So instead of reading it,
I stayed up and listened to Harry Partch's songAnd on the Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma,
dedicating it to the memory of Ramon Novarro,
hoping it would arch electrically above him
with all the characteristics of fire
all night,
all day,
and soak his early spring colors in a late autumn
sun as pale as silver and fern-green skiesto draw light
through midnight
