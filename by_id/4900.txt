The sheer luminous gown                           The fountain wears             Where Phoebe’s very own                           Color appears             Falls like a summer rain                           Or shawl of tears.Thus your soul ignitedBy pleasure’s lusts and needsSprays into heaven’s reachesAnd dreams of fiery deeds.Then it brims over, dying, And languorous, apart,Drains down some slope and entersThe dark well of my heart.             The sheer luminous gown                           The fountain wears             Where Phoebe’s very own                           Color appears             Falls like a summer rain                           Or shawl of tears.O you, whom night enhances,How sweet here at your breastsTo hear the eternal sadnessOf water that never rests.O moon, o singing fountain,O leaf-thronged night above,You are the faultless mirrorsOf my sweet, bitter love.             The sheer luminous gown                           The fountain wears             Where Phoebe’s very own                           Color appears             Falls like a summer rain                           Or shawl of tears.
