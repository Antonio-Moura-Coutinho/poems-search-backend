Sometimes, they’re on the same roofwearing handkerchiefs and uniformed men surround them.I mistake bullet casings for cormorant beaks divingtill water churns the color of sunsets, stained barnacles line the pierand I can’t see who’s facedown on boats lulled by crimson ripples.Once, I heard the man — alive and still on the roof — say  today for you, tomorrow for me. There’s a village where men train cormorantsto fish: rope-end tied to sterns, another to necks, so their beakswon’t swallow the fish they catch. My father is one of those birds.He’s the scarred man.
