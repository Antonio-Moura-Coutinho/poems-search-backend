No foot may chase,No eye can follow, to a fatal placeThat power, that spirit, whether on the wingLike the strong wind, or sleeping like the windWithin its awful caves.—From year to yearSprings this indigenous produce far and near;No craft this subtle element can bind,Rising like water from the soil, to findIn every nook a lip that it may cheer.
