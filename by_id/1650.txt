
I tied it to your wristWith a pretty pink bow, torn offBy the first little tug of wind.I’m sorry.I jumped to catch it, but not soon enough.It darted away.It still looked large and almost within reach.Like a heart.Watch, I said.You squinted your little eyes.The balloon looked happy, wavingGood-bye.The sky is very high today, I said.Red went black, a polka dot,Then not. We watched it,Even though we couldn’tSpot it anymore at all.Even after that.
