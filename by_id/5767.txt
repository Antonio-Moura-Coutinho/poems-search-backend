
I want the hole in my ear to be quietAnd inside the hole in my ear to be quietAnd I want it to tell me what to doOr I will go to my lover’s mouthAnd say oh my quietI am comingAnd tell the quiet how its kingdom should be madeThough the quiet has already eaten meBecause the quiet loves meBut does the lover love meAnd why must the quiet be so quietAnd why can’t the quiet have a cockAnd where is its violet mouthIts ten fingers with which to fix meAnd where is its belly breathingAnd O I want to be fixedBut I am already fixedWhy don’t I feel it
