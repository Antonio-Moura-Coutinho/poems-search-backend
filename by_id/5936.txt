We were not green in judgment or coldin blood like Cleopatra in her youthwho still was ordering chopped radishin her bowls back then,the hearts all gone to piecesnext to the winter greensthat in our days we never had use forso smitten were we with fireand ovens that I was gravy in judgment,which might not mean muchunless you’ve taken a spoonof it and poured it back over a dumplingshaped like your heartso that it became even softer,something you could not have thought possible.It’s all happening now,you liked to say, and I agreed,though it was not the newsfrom the outside I relished,but the daily Extra! Extra! the lightof the morning brought to my attentionevery time we woke in your houseor my house and my heart— salty, risen — was warmagain in a way it hadn’t been for years.Organ of passion, organ of righteousnessthat has never had a single flavor cross its lips,how could you knowhow much I would miss the honey of those days,her drizzle of it on the turkey bacon,my cracking pepper up and down the pan,the sweet meat of happiness I would no longer let pass between our teeth.
