
I’m thinking about you and you’re humming while cutting a piece of wood.I’m positive you aren’t thinking about me which is fine as long as youaren’t thinking about yourself. I know and love the way you inhabitthis house and the occasions we mutually create. But I don’t knowthe man you picture when you see yourself walking aroundthe world inside your head and I’m jealousof the attention you pay that personwhom I suspectof being devious.
