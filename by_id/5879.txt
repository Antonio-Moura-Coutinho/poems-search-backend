An old one,”so I bring a fight to you.You know nothing of these men;even the most famousget to slink in their youth again —for you Foreman is Leviathan, unstoppable;Ali just past his primeflown “home” to muscle back his title.Not sure how you’ll react to violencewe lie down again together —your feet in woollen stockingskneadable across my thighs,your mouth close to my ribsand their inmate: a pouting lifer.I fidget and you scold.As Ali opens up with right-hand leadsyou flinchbut soon you’re lost to the screenwhere he waits it out along the ropes,takes everything Foreman throws.You don’t believe he can soak upall this pain and go on standing;we cheer him on,winter softened in the tropic of his strength.When Ali comes alive to put Foreman on the groundI see a hallelujah look as you turn to face me.“He won,” you say into my cheek.“He did,” I say.
