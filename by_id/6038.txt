I hear it and it disappears It was all I wanted to do in this life to sense that phantom tap on my nerves, to allow myselfto be hit by it, attacked, arouseduntil, as if someone else, I ariseI dance my part in paradise ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I read that bees who’ve drunkimidaclopridcan’t waggle to indicate to others where the best nectar is located    (you and I also long to map   for each other the sweetest   suck of sap)Workers carry far less food back to the waiting hive. They wander, wobble can’t bring their way home alive The imidacloprid-imbibedcan’t bring it backto the colony.Some hives collapse entirely. I desire to say that I, I would do it differently I would be the bee, bloomed with pesticide that still would shake out a wigglelike the finger’s signatureon the iPad at checkout:      not quite you, but still identity       more like a wave than solid you       yet enough to signify: There, there, in the far off field spiked acanthus, trumpets of datura in the abandoned lot on the corner of International and High         the mystic assignation        the golden throat of light:                gorge, gorge, take               your fill, I would cry         before I too failed        and my bumbling body lay down to die I’d dance my last danceto rescue the hiveyes, I’d carry the amber whirrersout alive                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Or not. Perhaps I too would succumb to the corn syrup, chemical piped into our supply.(I, too, longing to find my way to you, would go off course.) Alas. There is still melody, rhythm, someone is streaking out in air, droning around the phonograph, which is the grooved heart valve of the black vinyl divine who is winding this universe. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Someone is dancing us.Will it be you?                                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Dance, dance, as the hive collapses Dance, dance, while the colony disassembles Dance the occasion Dance the gorgeous design                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ inside the honeyof our lit up veins                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~between the stripes and streams of these swift rays
