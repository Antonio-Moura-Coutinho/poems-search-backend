
if i said baby you might think a certain thing but nah.
that’s only maybe what i mean, perhaps i’ll say ma
& your mind says Cam’ron, women creeping up
but i’m a changed man, & that’s not game ma.
it’s practice in high school & THOT isn’t out yet.
we’re classic Chicago & bustdowns bloom in our mouths. my Ma
spits Too $hort & the line i catch the first time
is b*tch b*tch b*tch make me rich but Ma
puts me on punishment when i whisper Ludacris
& tells me sex shouldn’t hurt. i say nothing & Ma
lets it go until a few years later when i get becky
or brain or top or dome by a white girl & Ma
tells me everything i’ve risked for this escapade.
i can’t fix my mouth to say                     but Ma
what i got i didn’t ask for
