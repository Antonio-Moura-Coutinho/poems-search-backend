
Oh could I raise the darken’d veil,Which hides my future life from me,Could unborn ages slowly sail,Before my view—and could I seeMy every action painted there,To cast one look I would not dare.There poverty and grief might stand,And dark Despair’s corroding hand,Would make me seek the lonely tombTo slumber in its endless gloom.Then let me never cast a look,Within Fate’s fix’d mysterious book.
