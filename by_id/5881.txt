It is far too expensive for me,but the handwritten label [1915] brings it to my chest in armfuls of red.In that year, someone drew a bladethrough a bolt of fabric and stitchedthis coat into being. I carry itto the dressing room, slip my arms in.Silk lining spills against my skin. I clasp the beltand draw a slow breath as a cramp curls again,where blood stirs and melts. In glass,I am wrapped in the weight of old red:red pinched into girl cheeks and smeared from torn knees, lipstick blotted on tissue, bitten lips, a rough kiss, all the red bled into pads and rags, the weight of red, the wait for red, that we share. In the mirror, the old coat blushes.This pocket may once have sheltered somethingprecious — a necklace, a love letter, ora fresh egg, feather-warm, its shell brittlearound a hidden inner glow, held looselyso it couldn’t crack, couldn’t leak through seams,so it couldn’t stain the dress within.
