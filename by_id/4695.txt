
My husband doesn’t believe me—that the dogs barked nightly
at the spirit in the corner of the kitchen. That I knew of a family
whose quilts were flung against the wall mid-sleep. Once, I told him
I met Satan in Scandinavia, and she had pigtails and a machete
sticky with spiderwort. She couldn’t have been older than six
or seven. Her ancestors were Vikings. They boiled firestarters in urine
and when she approached me, she laughed and called me ugly
three times: stygg stygg stygg. With the same gurgle of the growling
dogs. With a film over her eyes, bobbled back into her head. Then
she giggled and ran away. Later in the hotel room, I anointed
my forehead with oil—right thumb tracing the Sign of the Cross,
howling in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
amen.
