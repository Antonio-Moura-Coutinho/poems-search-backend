
My cousin, Milton, worked for a cable company.
The boy I knew when we were children
 
had fists that were often clenched, his face set like
an old man whose life had been so hard,
 
it hardened him. But the man's hands opened to let
more of the world in. He sent the funniest
 
cards to family and friends at Christmas, laid down
cable so others could connect. Yet, he lived
 
alone, kept to himself much of the time, so when
his sister found his body, he'd been gone
 
a good while. He died young at fifty-seven, without
fuss or bother. No sitting by the bedside
 
or feeding him soup. He just laid himself down like
a trunk line and let the signal pass through.
