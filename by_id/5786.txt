
Perhaps it was just another break-in some years back.  Or the charm that suddenly seduces out of nowhere, long rehearsedtill you’ve realized too latethat half your living life went walking straightway out the doorinto the noonday glare of some Sunday godforsaken place­ — somewhere down in central Florida,the so-called Widow State you thought was safe­ — which at the time still remained obscure,so obscure, in fact,it was almost dark when you awoke, and so unlike yourselfas in a manic haze rifling through those drawersfor letters, tchotchkes, so much else. So you’d suddenly been had.There are times when the human frailties let down their guard.There is a ring of fire Dante so numbered, namedfor those who prey upon the old.The kids all grown up and living somewhere else,and you’re left alone stumbling down the hall.It could’ve been a friendly callat first. A friendly knock. A slight accent adding to the charm.A friend of a friend of a so-called friend no time to trace.That noonday glare of sunlight as a halo for that added touch.Have you forgotten anything? Anything?
