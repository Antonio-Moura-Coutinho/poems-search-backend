You sit in the back seat,             a ghost of red vinyl, to listento these boys—one of whom was you,the one along for the ride—talk              brave about cheerleaders              and socket wrenches as they passa stolen cigarette between them.They don’t know you’re there,              wouldn’t believe in you should              they look backstage, backseat.The boys are driving back from an Octoberorchard where they’d gone to see leaves              change. You remember: orange, brown,              as though you’d just seen those leaves,because in this proximityto yourself—the boy in the passenger               seat—you are thinking the               same thing, and each of your in-carnations feels like they’ve thought thisbefore. Your ghost, your present tense               thinks that maybe this isn’t right.               Now you’re along for the ride.These boys haven’t cuffed up againsttheir own mortality yet, though one               of them is sick. The other one,               driving and picking at the thinhair falling from his scalp, will diesoon, because what lurks in his dark               blood can be cured by medical               science. And that cure is what willkill him, as it leaves him weak,unable to fight off infection               in his lungs. But that comes later.               You are here with them now to findout what you owe to whom—your life,mortgaged to one of these boys               and you’ve never been able to               rectify that debt. You are thestage direction, a ghost backstage,wanting a spotlight, a soapbox               a soliloquy. Dissolve               back into your life, like sugarin tea—exit this scene now, stage left.                               *You are the apparition again               in your mother’s house. You follow               yourself down the yellow hallwayto the ringing phone in the kitchen.You already know who’s calling,               the way you knew then—when you were                the self you’re haunting. Your friendis dead. You know this even before his sister tells you—but because your               ghost is too close, the boy can feel               your grief, but can’t feel his own.And you did know then, didn’t you?You knew that morning, that the earth               awakes closest to the sun—four               days into every new year.And Lazarus, dead now, four days.Roll away the stone. Believe               in something besides the past.               Awaken from this dream likea man called out from a cave.It happens this way each time:               a bourbon breakdown in January               rain—weeping an invocation,cursing corollary.                               *Can you go to Tom’s grave today               and mandate him back to this life?               Should you cue him from the winglike a stage direction? Would hedamn you—a sadness, a gravestone               on your chest, for calling him               into this mortal suffering?If you had been in Houston that dayhe’d have died anyway. You’re a fool               to think you can bargain across the river.               Haunting the past won’t stopit from happening each time, exactly the same way. Won’t stop your heart               from breaking like a glass decanter,               brown whisky sliding mercury across the tile.
