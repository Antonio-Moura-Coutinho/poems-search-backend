Each night, Penelope, operatingin mythical time, unspools the light gray orb Schliemann has just unearthed. Come daylight, her hands will restitch it. The suitors sigh, waiting. And each night I’d watch as my hero curledhimself round home plate, as if he were going to bat for me. And I’d hold my breath, knowinga strong enough shot might be heard round the world. One must imagine Penelope. One must imagine Penelope happy.One must imagine Schliemann excavatingthe dugouts and outfields of Troy, carbon-dating the box score stats and the ticket stubshe pulls from the lurid dirt. He rubsthe remains of Achilles’s rage on his shirt.What does not kill you can still hurt.Penelope’s suitors are striking out,one after another. Their sad swings and misses. They can’t even get to first base. She’ll cutthe stitches once more, then blow them all kisses.Odysseus won’t care that the orb is undone.He’ll take a swing at it with all his might.The ball takes flight. Odysseus takes flight.It feels to Penelope like he’s been gonesince the dawn of mankind, but he’s already zoomed round third and flies like an arrow toward home, as the unearthly orb trails its guts in the air — the yarn fanning out like Penelope’s hair — not knowing yet whether to fall foul or fair.
