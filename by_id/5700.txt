Her safety meshwas torn in places and sun-bleached all overand threatened to dislodgedue to a forceful wind that was typicalof the season. She was shaking.She was fundamentally insecure.She told me that good foundations are essentialand that the men who had put her togetherhadn’t taken advantage of the right opportunities.Now, each day, someone came bycalled her “unsafe” and also “a liability”then left, failing to initiate the dismantling processthat yes would have been painfuland slow, but kinder.International visitors to the churchblamed her for the mess of tools and ragson the grounds and for the factthat they could no longer seethe church’s celebrated muraldepicting Saint Artemy of Verkolaunusually pioushighly veneratedchild saint killed by lightning.His dead body radiated lightnever showed signs of decayand was in fact said to have effectedmultiple miracles of healing.I said comforting things to the scaffoldbut she only seemed to lean more heavilyagainst the side of the church.We are rarely independent structures she saidbefore she dropped a bolt pinwhich released a long section of tubewhich released another bolt pinwhich released several wooden boardsthat scraped another tubeand made an unbearable sound.
