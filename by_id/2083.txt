The worstfor us: the hospital, his upper lip tugged backto show the gash—the flesh halved deeply,cleanly—while I hold him for the needlethat rubs pain out. He submitsto the quick stitch, the thread blackagainst pink skin, calm now he seesthe doctor can be trusted, his voicesoothing, his face clean shaven,the clues that signal kindness to a child.He’s worried, though, about his petwho didn’t mean it, Mom. His voice is flat.He knows the months he’s tried to woo this dogwere over when it leapt for his throatand caught his mouth. The scars, at least,will be invisible. At home, he’ll sleep,big boy between his parents, till he’s sureno beast will tear into his dreams. And wewill want him there, our bodies makeshift walls.We who led the stranger to our home,fixed him a bowl, taught him to sleepunder our blankets, we who taught our sonto rub the muzzle that sheathes the teeth.
