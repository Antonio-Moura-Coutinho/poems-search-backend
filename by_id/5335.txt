For “He spends the summerThere, in a state of violent agitation,”Read: “It’s there, in his agitation’s most violentState that Hölderlin suspends the summer” —Like a yellow pear above the untroubled water.For the lost, disheveled decades of derangement,Translate I was struck by Apollo as youMust change your life. For sonnets that sing their ownSpontaneous, Orphic necessity to praise,Think naked as a lightning rod he waited.For necessity insert Anangke. But forAnangke, “Lord, just one more summer, please.”For summer, the lyre. Hölderlin in his tower.Until autumn, when the leaves start falling. WhoeverHas nowhere to go will never get home now.
