
We are spendthrifts with words,
We squander them,
Toss them like pennies in the air–
Arrogant words,
Angry words,
Cruel words,
Comradely words,
Shy words tiptoeing from mouth to ear.
 
But the slowly wrought words of love
and the thunderous words of heartbreak–
Those we hoard.
