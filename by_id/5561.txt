Insteadmy markings of royaltywere the t-shirt draping my body like a robe soaked in champagne & the painin my right knee — a sign of a battle endured, my will tested & bested by none as the ball flew off my handsas swift as an arrow towardthe heart of a target — my fingers ringless yet feeling like gold.
