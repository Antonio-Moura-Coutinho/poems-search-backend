I came to light a candle for a friendbut Jesus had a really bad mustacheand those were only pinpricks in his palmsso I passed on.I came to light a candle for a friendbut Joseph’s hands were manicuredand soft as Fairy Liquid handsI could not light one there so I passed on.In the corner was a fellow with a cowled robeand a tonsure like a saucer — he palmeda young and curly blonde Adonis — so Ipassed on then to Benoît-Joseph Labre,a tattered man whose wide eyes blazed,he looked quite mad, had beggar’s hands,I liked him. I lit two dozen candles, didn’t pay,and nicked this book on him before I left.I did all this in honor of my matchless absent friend,whose honest calloused workman’s handsmaintained the half of Belfast,and nothing’s been the same since he passed on.
