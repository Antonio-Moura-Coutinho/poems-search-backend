Leaves inky greenand spiked.                      Like blissed-out childhood play               turned mean they snarled in tangled curls on our driveway.It happens still. That desolating fallingshudder inside                            and then our neighborhood                seems only sprawlingloops...like the patterns eaten on driftwood:even the home where I grew up (its smellof lingering                      wood-smoke and bacon grease)             seems just a shellof lathe and paper. But this strange releasefollows: this tinge like silver and I feelthe pull of dirt                             again, sense mist uncurling               to revealno architecture hidden behind the worldexcept the stories that we make unfolding:as if our sole real power                                                     were the power             of children holding this flower that is a weed that is a flower.
