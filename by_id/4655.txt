
: sorry this not that poem
raised block flower & plant bed.
  peonies, gardenias, poinsettias
plus a yellow orb slow-rising
  over an endless golden scape—
darting through uncluttered space
  cardinals, thrashes, sparrows
blue air fragrant with lavender
  washing brain matter into virtue.
if only i could pastel language
  onto a canvas of thistledown
yes, deceit comes to mind—
  .a lie. traitor. turncoat. recreant
backstabber to truth i would be
  gut-shanked a thousand times.
this is not that poem nor am i
  that poet to hold your hand
.or. erase knot-hole screams
  blood on a cement floor .or.
suicide is another form of escape
  no-no-no—but i do promise
the evil-ugly humans inflict
  to each other to their [selves]
how time is malice is death
  enflaming pupils with spite
inextinguishable if ever set free—
  forgive state poet #289-128
for not scribbling illusions
  of trickery as if timeless hell
could be captured by stanzas
  alliteration or slant rhyme—
