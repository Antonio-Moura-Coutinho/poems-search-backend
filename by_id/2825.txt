
Look at me now, I stand before you, a man
       whom life has made a gullible skeptic.
Life so obvious and strange,
            so full of marvels and dross
even in our sleep we create monuments
                even in our graveWhat more can we askthan to never know what to expect        Each day has a different emissaryYesterday she was sharp-eyed
