
I collect them now, it seems. Like sea-shells or old thimbles. One for Father. One forMother. Two for my sweet brothers. Odd how little they require of me. Unlike theones they were sent in memory of. No sudden shrilling of the phone. No harriedmidnight flights. Only a little water now and then. Scant food and light. See how I’vebrought them all together here in this shaded space beyond the stairs. Even when theythirst, they summon me with nothing more than a soft, indifferent furl- ing of their leaves.﻿
