
A clamor, in the distance. A crowd running under the rain beatingdown, between the canvases the sea wind set clattering.A man passes crying something. What is he saying? What heknows! What he has seen! I make out his words. Ah, I almostunderstand!I took refuge in a museum. Outside the great wind mixed withwater reigns alone from now on, shaking the glass panes.In each painting, I think, it’s as if  God were giving up on finishingthe world.  Translated from the French
