
Bones are easier to find than flowersin the desert, so I paint these:Fine white skulls of cows and horses.When I lie flat under the starsin the back of the car, coyotes howlingin the scrub pines, easy to feel how those bonesare so much like mine: Here is my pelvis,like the pelvis I found todaybleached by the sun and the sand. Samehole where the hip would go, samewhite curve of bone beneath my fleshsame cradle of life, silent and still in me.
