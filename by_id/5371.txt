It hurtsto imagine it, regardlessof the harvester’sdenials, swiveling his knife to make the incision: onedull cyst nickedfrom the oyster’s mantle — its thread of red gland no biggerthan a seed of  trout roe — pressed inside the tenderedflesh. Both hosts easedopen with a knife (as if anythingcould be said to be easedwith a knife): so that one pearlafter another can be harvested, polished, added to others until a single rope is strung on silk. Linked by what you thinkis pain. Nothing could be so roughly handled and yet feel so little, your pity turned into part of this production: you with your small,four-chambered heart, shyness, hungers, envy: whatcould be so precious you’d cleave another to keep itclose? Imagine the weeks it takes to wind nacre over the redseed placed at the other heart’s mantle. The mussel become what no one wants to:vessel, caisson, wounded into making us the thing we wantto call beautiful.
