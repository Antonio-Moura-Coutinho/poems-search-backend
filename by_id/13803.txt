She stalls in the kitchen, putting the kettle on,   buys herself a minute looking for two   matching cups for the lime-flower tea,   not really lime but linden, heart-shaped leaves   and sticky flowers that smell of antifreeze.   She talks a wall around her, twists the string   tighter around the tea bag in her spoon.
