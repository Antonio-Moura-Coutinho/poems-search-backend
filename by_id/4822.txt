
The silence of night hoursis never really silent.You hear the air,even when it doesn’t stir.It’s a memory of the day.Nothing stirs. Memory lags.No traffic hushing upand down tricky hillsamong the camphor trees.No foghorns, no streetcars’shrilling phantoms beforethey emerge from tunnels.These absences keep us alert.No rain or street voices,nobody calling to someone else,Hannah, you walk the dog tonight yet or what?
