
The hastily assembled angel thinks
He must be more like God than people are
Especially because he like God can’t
Choose to be less like God      he tilts his chair
Back his brown metal folding      chair on its
Back legs and lifts      first his right leg and then
His left      onto the wolf-sized rock he’s using
As his desk      while the great flood floods the plains
The valleys and the forests far below him
And the mountains      eventually his mountain
Eventually his right      leg on the rock
His left crossed over at the ankles WantingTo be like God he thinks must be the wrong way
To be like God      who doesn’t want to be
Like anything      but I don’t want
To be like God
