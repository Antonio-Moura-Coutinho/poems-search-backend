The book open on my chest, a towelat my back      the diving board thwoking,and leaving never arrived      Cut it outmy mother said     my brother clowning around with a water gun     Cut it out.The planes arrowed into silence, fourteen,fifteen, sixteen, always coming home from summer     over the bridge to Brooklyn.The father stabbed on Orange Street,the Betamax in the trash, the Sasha doll the dog chewed up, hollow plastic arms gaping. Powdered pink lemonade, tonguing the sweet grains                                                        liquid-thick. I could stand in that self   for yearswondering is it better to anticipate than to age     Imagining children with five different men,a great flood that would destroy your possessions     and free you to wander. Bathing suits and apples and suntan oiland a mother bending over youshadow of   her face on yours. It’s gone,that way, the breeze, the permanent pool.A father saying “ghost” and the sheetsslipping off   the oak tree’s bough.When I wake, leaves in the water. You could say greenforever and not be lying. 2 The pond near the house in Mainewhere we lived for one year to “get away” from the city     the pondwhere the skaters     on Saturdays came,red scarves     through white snow,voices drawing near and     pullingaway, trees against the clouds. Trying to liveoff   the land for a while. Too hardin the end my father said.     What did he say? Forget it     you weren’t listening     He worefishing overalls most days and stank of   guts.Our shouts slipping, the green garbage cansedging the white scar pond,so many days like secrets about to bedivulged . . .                                         White snow;to stink of   fish guts but     to be tryingto live:               the pond near the houseand the sound of   voices     drawing near.As you aged you got distracted, indebted. In the hospital around my motherthe machines     beeped,the long leads of   the heart monitor,drooping parabolas. It’s not worth dying for     she said. Whatwas it she meant? Swollen shells, the desiccated brown seedpods we used to pinch onto our noses and skate about     putting on airs. Then the books openedtheir pages and with our red woolenscarves flying and the Freezy Freakies’ once-invisible hearts reddening into the cold we disappeared. Evian bottles skitter against the chain-link fence.It’s gone     that way     the green planes arrowing into silence     gum wrappersslipping to the ground.O wild West Wind     be thou our friend and blow away the trash. Salvage us from     the heap of our making andCut it out my mother said     Stop worryingabout the future, it doesn’tbelong to us and we don’t belong to it.3 The surface more slippery, slickand white the ice. I stand at the pond’s edge gather the information     darkening there hello algae     hello fish pond my mind in the depths     going. On the beach I dig, tunnel to the hands of   the woman who stitched this red shirt     holes all the way to China.It got so easy to     get used to it, the orchestration of meaning against the night, life a tower you could climb onnot a junk heap     pale picture booksyellowing on the shelves. It got so     I close my eyes and walk along the hospital hall.The iris quivering in the March light,a nurse taking my mother’s pulsenot paid enough to help us as we wished to be helped. And your hope left behind     turning the pages of   magazines, the models in Prada. As a girlit was a quest, to feel exploded every second,pudding pops     and Vietnam vets standing on the corner shaking their Styrofoamcups.     Holding her cup my mother stands, petting the dog,it’s 1982     the sun tunneling in     she drinks her coffeeCut it out or     Forget it or     Hello. Look, I’ve made a telephone for us.Put that cup to your ear, and I’ll put it to mine,and listen     I just need to findone of those Styrofoam cups and what about you     where did yougo what kind of night is it there electric synthetic blackened or burnt.4 At night they come to youdistorted and bright, like an old print on a light box, present,     present,          not quite. Are we inventing them as we sleep, or are they still     happeningin a time we can’t touch?The hockey game on the bluetv glowing and slowing     I come home to a man slumped on the couch not-quite-sayinga greeting     all the gone ones there the slap of skates     all goneand the commentator it’s going on foreverthe blade moving along rinksays What a slapshot what a shot.You make a life, it is made of days anddays, ordinary and subvocal, not busy becoming what they could be,               dark furlings of tiny church feelings, mysterious, I mean,and intricate like that high-windowed light —intricate and mysterious          I come home. Near our house we hung out on the Promenade after school the boys smokingthe security systems in the Center blinking     a disco party blue red / blue red the East Riverreflecting scraped sky     cornices and cloudswe could hear the roar of cars across it and taste the chemical airof   the offices the fathers worked inwe’d been there to pick them up for the long weekend in the Catskillsthe hum-gray computers, the ibm Selectrics massive on the desks, eleven, twelve, thirteen, riding the graffitied subways,flirting, the boys     grabbing us calling     hey     hey.Changeable one day to the next.Jon talking of atheismblond hair in strips          At night the bomb mushroomingover the Statue of   Liberty, white blinding everywhere.          Oh, she said, don’t worryjust a dream          just a dream.Everyone is scared of   Russia. Imagine          she laughed     We used to have to hide under our desks!

And the small voicesof children     enter the room, they soundso narrow and light and possible. Butdon’t you think we’re always making the samestanding at the car rentalkind of mistake we began by makingat the last minute, rushing to callour fathers before setting off for vacation.     It’s warmer this August than it has been for decades.Still the sun bathing us isn’t preposterousor cold.
