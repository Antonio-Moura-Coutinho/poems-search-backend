I have built a house in the middle of the OceanIts windows are the rivers flowing from my eyesOctopi are crawling all over where the walls areHear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against  the windowpanes House of dampness House of burning Season’s fastness Season singing The airplanes are laying eggs Watch out for the dropping of the anchor  Watch out for the shooting black ichor It would be good if you were to come from the skyThe sky’s honeysuckle is climbingThe earthly octopi are throbbingAnd so very many of us have become our own gravediggersPale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaksAround the house is this ocean that you know well  And is never still Translated from the French
