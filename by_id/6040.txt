Their shitis always hot. Their shit isalways cheap. Their shit isalways landmark of poisonin pens, along with: windowswearing boards, hubcapsleaning curbs, the sound of“bitch,” the sound of “mother-fucker,” the sound of “niggah” sounding off, projectile vomitingfrom children’s lips — our hushpuppy young, made beastsbehind these bars. Some daysyou will see them, dirt bike knights, riding Edmondson Avenue, armor-less. They arewheelies, jousting against traffic,wheelies, jousting against stop-lights, gas tanks bleeding outon stretchers, as sirens serenade,metal flies hover. There areskeletons of chickens scattered onthe ground. There are meeting bonesof children fractured in the street,cordoned off.This is urban warming. This isunderwear in exhibition, pantssaddened to sag, hanging off asscracks, like wet clothes on a line.This is the ecology of locks, sinceour country is locks, since ourcolor is locks, since this block islocked. When your order is up,you will eat anything tossed insidethe cage.
