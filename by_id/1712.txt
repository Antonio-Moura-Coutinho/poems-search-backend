
Sir Charles into my chamber coming in,When I was writing of my ‘Fairy Queen;’‘I pray’—said he—‘when Queen Mab you do seePresent my service to her Majesty:And tell her I have heard Fame's loud reportBoth of her beauty and her stately court.’When I Queen Mab within my fancy viewed,My thoughts bowed low, fearing I should be rude;Kissing her garment thin which fancy made,I knelt upon a thought, like one that prayed; And then, in whispers soft, I did presentHis humble service which in mirth was sent;Thus by imagination I have beenIn Fairy court and seen the Fairy Queen.
