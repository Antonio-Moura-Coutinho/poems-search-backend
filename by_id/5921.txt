I am sure I donot believe we canmove a pencil througha white field, pulled bya team of upside-down ox-head letterAs, and in real factfurrow it. Poor oldpage-earth — sized, cut, scraped, ploughed with mule-pencilsor impressed by ink,illuminated,printed, obscurelyinscribed, and reveredor destroyed, reveredand destroyed, and herecomes yet anotherwalled-garden crop foreye, ear, lungs, legs, mind. • The cranium domehangs from its own silkconceptual threadof thought, conceivingits infinite in-complete perfection:its Zeno, its Zeus,its Dante, its TeDeums and freak shows,frescoes, twine theory,money, bread, bricks andwine, six-syllableabstractions, axesand facts, its everyvariation ofcustom, includingvertical graves ofmen buried upsidedown without their heads.• (In dusk-lit, telling ways, tell me, little swallow, Tuscan or T’ang or wrung somehow from time: since I have neither feather nor wing, how I too cango into a gravemade only of air.)• “For your sweet joy, take“from my cupped hands a“little glittering“of sun, a little“honey — for this is“what Persephone’s“bees have commanded.“A boat can’t cast off“if it isn’t moored;“no one can hear a“shadow that wears fur“boots; we can’t best our“fright in this dark wood.“Our kisses — these are“all that we can save,“velvety as bees“that die if they are“exiled from the hive.“They’re murmuring in“the transparent groves “of the night; the wilds“of mountain Greece are“their motherland; their“diet is time, lung-“wort, pale meadowsweet.“For joy, please take this“pagan gift: this rude,“rustling necklace of“the bees that died, for“these had transmuted“honey into sun.”
