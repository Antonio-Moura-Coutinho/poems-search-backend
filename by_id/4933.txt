Carlight,east red and west white.Women, and men made of them,and lambs in their droves, and power lines eastto the women-made men and women of men,when a man is a sumof what women he knows, and I blurred my vision till Isaw a woman and lambs in the streets,west red and white east,and I wanted to eat. Women and men,donâ€™t fear me, I am a hand come to wake her. Red in the west sayswoman is man is woman is man.
