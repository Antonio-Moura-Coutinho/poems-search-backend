
I still see those men haphazardly standing
around the comps’ floor, mostly silent,
lost in their latest urgent jobs,
looking up and down as if nodding yes
 
from what they call their composers’ sticks
as they set inverse words and lines
of each page that could be taken for
Greek scripture, declaring:
 
In the beginning was the Word and the Word
was made cold type and the Word was
coldness, darkness, shiny greyness
and light—and the Word dwelt amongst us.
 
                                      *
 
Oh, I know these men would laugh this off.
They’d say, if they simply didn’t throw
their eyes to heaven, that they were just ordinary
characters trying to keep the devil from the door,
 
and with luck have enough left over each week
to back a few nags, and go for a few jars.
But they can’t say anything or set anything now.
They are scattered from that place that’s not
 
the same any more and many have left
any place we know of in this life,
calling to mind the old names for printing:The Mysterious Craft or simply The Mystery.
 
                                          *
 
I set them up in another city, another country
that’s as far away in distance
from that city as it’s far in time.
But they are still composing,
 
cracking the odd joke above
their sticks and galleys on some floor
of some building that is eternally busy
inside me even when I’ve forgotten
 
that I’ve forgotten them; forgetting
the world behind the word—
every time I read the word world I wonder
is it a typo and should I delete the l.
 
                                          *
 
Now again I hanker to know the quality
of each letter: the weight, the texture, the smell,
the shiny new type, the ink-dark shades of old,
the different types of type, the various sizes
 
within the same font, the measures in ems,
picas,  points and units. I’d set the words up,
making something out of all this
that stays standing—all set as masterly
 
as the words those men set that reveal
something of the mystery behind
and within these letters and the wonder and
the darkness, but with the lightest touch.
 
                                          *
And the umpteen ways things can foul up
are beyond telling. Maybe the type is off,
or the typesetter may not be up
to the work, if only out of a hangover
 
setting an ! where there should be a ?
or a b where there should be a d,
or miss aspace or a line or dingbat.
And the proofreaders don't catch the error,
 
passing the copy on as clean, or the make-up man
fouls the assembly page, or the stoneman errs
as he fastens the page of cold type and furniture
with the chase, turning the quoin’s key.
 
                                          *
 
Not to speak of the evil eye cast by
fellow composers ready
to knock the words of others, or the bosses
writing on the composition: Kill.
 
Old Shades, keep my words from such eyes
and fretting about that pied world and let me go
on regardless. And even if I foul up and the stewards
are right to set Kill on my last page and my words
 
are distributed and thrown in the hellbox,
the real achievement will be that I tried to set
the words right; that I did it with much labor
and not without a font of love. But that said,
 
                                          *
 
grant me the skill to free the leaden words
from the words I set, undo their awkwardness,
the weight of each letter of each word
so that the words disappear, fall away
 
or are forgotten and what remains is the metal
of feeling and thought behind
and beyond the cast of words
dissolving in their own ink wash.
 
Within this solution we find ourselves,
meeting only here, through The Mystery,
but relieved nonetheless to meet, if only
behind the characters of one fly-boy’s words.
