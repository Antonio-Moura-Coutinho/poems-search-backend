
Know no name
Why this holy day honed
Hollow day haul
I lost wind when wooden
I can’t bear to be
Unaided in hunt unhanded
To haunt when strewn sound
Who will be held in hand
Brought sent
Mooring at the shore
Who’re you for
For what fewer who wore
Be called this wooer
More who are the ones
In horror to light will strew
then sue for war
