
I want to leave this placeunremembered.The gas stove is leakingand the door of the refrigeratorstained with rust.The mugs are uglyand there are only two forks.The walls are blackand soft, the bed a balloonof night-clothing.The stairwell slopedto a draggerâ€™s pace.There are big windowswith blind-slats dustyand gray. Street life goes all night and at dawnfreedmen shout and laugh outside the kitchen.Where does life begin and end?In the lamb or the cotton?My pillow is my friend.
