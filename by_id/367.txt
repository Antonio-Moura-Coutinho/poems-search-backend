
woodstove of my childhood
 
where potatoes cut like triangle chips were fried
in manteca de marrano
 
woodstove of lazy autumn smoke swirling away
to nowhere
 
woodstove of December
evacuating the cold chill at sunrise
 
woodstove of celebration and mourning
 
of post-World War II Korea y Vietnam
 
woodstove corner that kept vigil over
drunken nodding remembrance
 
woodstove corner where uncles primos compadres
gathered on visits from Califas
 
woodstove corner with a warm ear for nostalgia
 
where Mama Ane stirred the atole and wrung her hands
thumb over thumb praying for her children's children's children
 
woodstove that witnessed six decades washing its face at the vandeja
that saw western swing dancing in dim lantern flame
 
that watched Elvis come in from across the llano strumming
a mail-order Stella and singing in Spanish
 
woodstove
of the feast lamb tied up under the crabapple tree
 
of early sour cherries ripening above the cornstalk horizon
 
of neighbors bartering a cup of sugar
in exchange for mitote and conversation
 
woodstove of rain tenderly pouring into the afternoon
and salt sprinkling onto the patio from the mouth of the porch
 
woodstove of the nighttime crackling softly
 
of harmonious harmonica medleys
blowing before bedtime prayer
 
woodstove facing John F. Kennedy's
picture on the wall
 
woodstove of Protestant Sundays
ringing without bells
 
woodstove of dark earth
fat worms and acequias
 
woodstove of 1960s propaganda
and all the rich hippies knocking poorly at the screen door
 
woodstove of private crazy laughter
 
of woodpeckers pecking through rough-hewn
barn timbers only to meet the sky
 
of rabbits nervously nibbling evening away
in the arroyo
 
of the water bucket banging and splashing
all the way home
 
woodstove of the water drop sizzle
 
of buñuelos and biscochitos and flour on the chin
 
of chokecherry jam dropping out
from the end of a tortilla
 
woodstove
that heard Mentorcito's violin bringing in the new year
 
that saw Tío Eliseo bring in an armload of wood
 
that heard Tío Antonio coming down the road
whistling a corrido and swinging his cane
 
woodstove of the blessed noontime
and Grandma Juanita heating up the caldito
 
woodstove of the sanctified and untamed holy spirit
 
of the dream awake dreamers
prophesizing in the beginning how the end would come
 
of creaking trochil gates left open forever
 
of twisted caved-in gallineros rocking
in weeping April wind
 
of abandoned orchards waist deep
in desánimo
 
of teardrops that held back the laughter
 
of the penitente procession moving through the hills
for the soul of the village
 
woodstove of the wounded faithful proudly
concealing their scars
 
woodstove of armpit farts and bedtime giggles
 
of pitchforks and axes under the bed in case of intruders
 
of coffee cans filled with everything but coffee
 
of ten cents for a cream soda at Corrina's
 
of strawberry Nehis and a bag of chili chips at Medina's
 
of a handful of bubble gum acá Santos's
 
woodstove of genius wisdom dressed up as the village idiot
 
of hand-me-down stories locked away
in the dispensa
 
of bien loco local heroes cracking homeruns
Saturday afternoons en la cañada
 
woodstove
of all that and more of all that disappearing
 
as children played hide 'n' seek in that abandoned goodtime feeling
while stumbling on the footsteps of tradition
 
woodstove that heard the fall of a people rising in silence
 
that died of a loneliness without cure
that cured itself in the company
 
of the so many more lonely
 
woodstove of my childhood
