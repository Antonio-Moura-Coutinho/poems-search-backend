It feels illicit and somewhat right to stand across the intersection without shouting her name, or even waving.According to the internettutorial, the fact that photons turn into tiny loyal billiard ballsas soon as we start watching suggestsno error of method or measurement, but rather, as far as anyone can tell, an invisibly unstable world, a shaking everywhere that seeing must pin down and fix.So, that morning I stumbled on youout, alone, bending throughthe traffic at Orange and Edwards Streets:a someone else then whom I, alone, can never otherwise see —there has to be a kind of   speechbeyond naming, or even praise,a discipline that locates light and lets it go.
