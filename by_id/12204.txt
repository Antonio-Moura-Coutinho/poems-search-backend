Down the hall and oceans distantI listened to her work to wash eventsaway as quickly as they accumulated.A sort of race. I thought of where the soapwas going. Targets glowed on monitorsin the base’s trailers near Las Vegasand operators in full flight suits drankcoffee from paper cups and adjustedaltitude as I stroked myself beneaththe blankets. I don’t like to take chancesand haven’t been to Vegas in years. The pilotscall people who run for cover, black spermwrithing across their screens, “squirters.”Near my finish line she tugged up the puckeredrubber no-slip safety mat. The sound shouldremind you of a time a doctor tookhold of your arm for comfort or leverageand tore the bandage off. If nothing likethis has happened to you, imagine it.The haberdasher in Diderot who stolehis wife’s dowry (long story) plans to leaveParis for Geneva, sensing distancewill make him less guilty. She wasn’t comingback to bed. She may already have left.Villagers call the drones, which makea buzzing sound, “wasps.” The radioreported to an empty room. “An assassin,”writes Diderot, “if transported to the shoresof China, will lose sight of the corpsehe left bleeding on the banks of the Seine.”Asia’s always such a great place to hide,but Geneva’s obviously more convenient.Say she expected her husband to returnfrom duty in a month. Would anythingwe did between now and then make usany more or less wretched than we were?The drone returns to Bagram withoutthe missiles it left with and a soldierrestores its complement. Either his nameis Dan or else imagine that. And thata cuckold’s rage can snuff a bomb. I cameinto either a tissue or my fist. This wasweeks or months ago, and I can’t recall.When de Castañeda and his men clambereddown into the Grand Canyon in 1540,they found the boulders which had lookedas tall as a man from the rim in factstood taller than Seville’s La Giralda.They must have marveled at distance’s powerto deceive and to wake deception’s twin, oblivion.Their women and homes forgotten. You can’thear their screams from here, but they’re there.
