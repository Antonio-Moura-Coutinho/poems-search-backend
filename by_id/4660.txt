Saturday. The good bread set out for the dogs to eat.The rabbit hurt on milk & tall willows
that I’ve bound to storefront. The headlines saythe waves are coming in today. The waves
& spoiled fruit & all the lives I’ve wastedplaying archer. At least this side of the kingdom
will still love me. I pull the weeds. I pull the tides& storm the shores. The rabbit drops its mouth
into a crater. The waves overtake the red citywith spears in hand. June & the headlines
announce the end of the world. I am terribleat playing heroine. I’ve done all I can: plucked
the apples, swept the chimney. Washed the rabbit,saved the tortoise from its slow drowning.
