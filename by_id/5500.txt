
I’ve come to this one grassy hillin Ramallah, off Tokyo Street,to place a few red anemones& a sheaf of wheat on Darwish’s grave.A borrowed line transported me beneatha Babylonian moon & I found myselflucky to have the shadow of a coatas warmth, listening to a poet’s songof Jerusalem, the hum of a red stringCaesar stole off Gilgamesh’s lute.I know a prison of sunlight on the skin.The land I come from they also dreamtbefore they arrived in towering shipsbattered by the hard Atlantic winds.Crows followed me from my home.My coyote heart is an old runagateredskin, a noble savage, still Lakota,& I knew the bow before the arch.I feel the wildflowers, all the grasses& insects singing to me. My sacred deadis the dust of restless plains I come from, & I love when it gets into my eyes & mouthtelling me of the roads behind & ahead.I go back to broken treaties & smallpox,the irony of barbed wire. Your envoycould be a reprobate whose inheritanceis no more than a swig of firewater. The sun made a temple of the bonesof my tribe. I know a dried-up riverbed& extinct animals live in your nightmaressharp as shark teeth from my mountainsstrung into this brave necklace aroundmy neck. I hear Chief Standing Bearsaying to Judge Dundy, “I am a man,”& now I know why I’d rather die a poetthan a warrior, tattoo & tomahawk.
