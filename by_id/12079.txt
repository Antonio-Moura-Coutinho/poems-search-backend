
I miss the moshpit pushed to the side of the bed.The hard and fast rules, the business,Walking across town the baby’s hand in mineGave me anxiety Rosado barely mellowed.Who doesn’t love to hear about anxiety.You wouldn’t be too wrong to wake from dreamingInto an amusement park sluice of RiojaEau de post-Auden thanks a lot Timex hubbub.Those feelings are in their way good luck.I don’t even need a communion waferTo feel the need to broadcast imprecationsFade like a docent as the hedge fund falls.
