
There lies a somnolent lakeUnder a noiseless sky,Where never the mornings breakNor the evenings die.Mad flakes of colour Whirl on its even faceIridescent and streaked with pallour;And, warding the silent place,The rocks rise sheer and grayFrom the sedgeless brink to the skyDull-lit with the light of pale half-dayThro’ a void space and dry.And the hours lag dead in the air With a sense of coming eternityTo the heart of the lonely boatman there:That boatman am I,I, in my lonely boat,A waif on the somnolent lake,Watching the colours creep and floatWith the sinuous track of a snake.Now I lean o’er the sideAnd lazy shades in the water see,Lapped in the sweep of a sluggish tideCrawled in from the living sea;And next I fix mine eyes,So long that the heart declines,On the changeless face of the open skiesWhere no star shines;And now to the rocks I turn,To the rocks, aroundThat lie like walls of a circling sunWherein lie boundThe waters that feel my powerless strengthAnd meet my homeless oarLabouring over their ashen lengthNever to find a shore.But the gleam still skimsAt times on the somnolent lake,And a light there is that swimsWith the whirl of a snake;And tho’ dead be the hours i’ the air,And dayless the sky,The heart is alive of the boatman there:That boatman am I.
