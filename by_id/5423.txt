Wind blew through the trees;I could hear, very faintly, sounds of  weeping several rows away,and beyond that, a dog wailing. At length these sounds abated. It crossed my mindI had no memory of   being driven here,to what now seemed a cemetery, though it could have beena cemetery in my mind only; perhaps it was a park, or if not a park,a garden or bower, perfumed, I now realized, with the scent of roses — douceur de vivre filling the air, the sweetness of  living,as the saying goes. At some point,it occurred to me I was alone.Where had the others gone,my cousins and sister, Caitlin and Abigail?By now the light was fading. Where was the carwaiting to take us home?I then began seeking for some alternative. I feltan impatience growing in me, approaching, I would say, anxiety.Finally, in the distance, I made out a small train,stopped, it seemed, behind some foliage, the conductorlingering against a doorframe, smoking a cigarette.Do not forget me, I cried, running nowover many plots, many mothers and fathers —
