How absurdto still have a body in this rainbow-gored,crickety world and how ridiculous to be given onein the first place, to be an objectlike an orchid is an object, or a stone,so bruisable and plummeting, armswaving from the evening-ignited lake,heading singing in the furnace feral and sweet,tears that make the face grotesque,tears that make it pure. How easyit is now to get drunk on a single whiff like a hummingbird or ant, on the laughterof one woman and who knew how much I’d missthat inner light of snow now that I’m in Texas.
