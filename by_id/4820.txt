The finger that taps and feathers your earbut the giggle’s gone before you turn around.The sandalwood scent hanging in the room,the auburn strand like a flaw in the porcelain,the off-course nail clipping in the carpet.The days eat into your stomach, knife youwith longing for relief from lovethat you cannot leave or leave alone,from its rings of fire where you won’tburn down to ash or be transformed.You become them, and they keep burningand have a coffeeberry voice.           Listen how                     their rhymes sing                               the little deaths you live.
