You were, she reminds him,our resident nomad, come to pitch your tent here, sidewalks for sand, unaccustomed taboos: Morningside Heights, one of your lives.                                        Thirty years since the awkward goodbye? Before he goes—East Africa his beat, Germany hers—he’llvisit the nephew, the namesake in Bostonwho drives a cab, sends a pittance each month to a wellhead in—we’ll call it Sudan. He explains how it works, this drip feedof cash to Sudan from the United States: cheap, fast. She’s not clear about this—he jots her a website: it’s a place she can go. So they won’t meet again...suddenlyCan you forgive me? he blurts—a classmate’s apartment, Upper West Side,the grown child’s room, bearsin tidy shrines, scrum of sloughed coats. In the kitchen friends wash up. Soundof laughter. Sound of water flowingout of a tap. Yes, she replies, shockedby the twinge, then ache, of remorse.She “forgot”? And him—thirty years—the place still hurts? It’s myself I can’t forgive,she knows later. Right now, vague shame. End of March. Maybe April. Street treesare trying to bloom. The irretrievablesits on the table, white as a plate. He holds herher coat.
