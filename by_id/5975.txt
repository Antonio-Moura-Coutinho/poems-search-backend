No brown skin Adonis weaving trails of industrial Vaseline down a cobblestone street. Heisman-shuckingtrash receptacles. Grand jeté over the little blue recycling bin, a prism of clouds rising beneath his feet. Nobody all-fuckedin boot cuffs wide enough to cloak court appointed tethers. Or slumped over, hoodie-shrouded — sheepishly scary according toone eye witness. Definitely not going to be your Louis V Sweat Suit red carpet fashion review, coming at you live from E! & Fox News outside of the morgue. No chance for homeboy in the peekaboo boxer shorts. Homeboy with the frozenwrists. Iced. Homeslice with the paisley, Pretty Flacko Flag flying by the seat of low-slung denim — no defenseattorney gets to call me Gang Related. Tupac in a mock leather bomber. No statement takenfrom the Clint Eastwood of your particular planned community, saying he had the right to stand his groundat the Super Target. Because my flat-billed, fitted cap cast a shady shadow over his shoulder in the checkout line. No, siree.See, I practice self target practice. There is no sight of me in my wears. I bedecked in No Wrinkle Dockers. Sensiblenavy blazer. Barack Obama tie, Double Consciousness- knotted. Stock dandelion pinned to the skin of an Americanlapel with his head blown off.
