It foretellsthe near death of a hundred clouds to the shining host. A thin layer of dust,the seer leaves his footprints on the roofsas he walks home from the future not his own, swallowing his voice —in its rays, fat blood flows down the golden armor. Wetblue entrails. Large headshave rolled down the shoulders. Speech has grown silent in deep mouths.  .................................................The signs of a life without past will emerge like lies through the lines of an old page,emptiness will turn into loss,foreign sand into Ithaca.Ithaca is the time when there’s nowhere to go. If it’s night, it means the night is the end of the voyage. A sackcloth hiding the shoulders of the stranger is truer thanspeeches about past and futurehe won’t make. Nobodywill. On the streets rain readies hollows for the funeral, already overgrown with grass. In a long puddle he sees:a pauper, a random victim of the skieshangs with his head down. In height, he is a cloud, the sizeof a lost faithin returning home.  .......................So should I, a pauper sitting by a stranger’s door, declare: I’m Odysseus,and I’m back. Should I say: I’m recognized. After the mourning songstears are still rolling down my face. I have beensummoned to clothe the pastin the shining ice.
