Millions of yearsthey have blown hereon ancestral longing,their wings of wide arrival, necks long, legs stretched out above strands of earthwhere they arrivewith the shine of water, stories, interminablelanguage of exchanges descended from the skyand then they stand,earth made only of crane from bank to bank of the river as far as you can seethe ancient story made new.
