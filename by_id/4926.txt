I oftenslosh through the low tide to a sisterunattached to causeways.It’s where deer mate then lead their youngby my house to fields, again up above me.Pray for me. Like myself be lost.An amulet under your chest, a green sign of the firstrose you ever saw, the first shore.Then I wash my horse, dogs, me behind the barn.Only the narrow way leads home.
