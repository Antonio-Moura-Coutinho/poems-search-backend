
A high school mash note’s stammering lust.Father and me, shirts and ties, snapshot glare,and somehow graphed into that aira young man’s foolscap poem when a just,loose joinery of words was all that mattered.But then in last night’s dream, she (mother, wife,mash note’s love?) tells me a box holding secret lifehas been shipped, enclosing sounds I haven’t heard:a wind-harp’s warp, words yarding across staves,fluty sounds ribboned to sad, screechy tunes.And things: a wishbone, ring, whatever I crave,the heart-hollows, the cannot-do-withouts, the whensand whos, the frayed veils between death and here...I packed this box myself. I packed it full of fear.
