How benevolent the cause for those slim, aching moments of blinding obscurity,and the blinds drawn and the sunlight louvereduntil even the knickknacks cling to their dust as to Timepassing passing, if even that. The yearningto be not bothered, to be passed on the street,the rehab, the food mart, the many shoppe window reflections. So manytimes, the eyes averted in fear,so many times you remain obscure, even to your more obscured self.A silence charting your whereaboutsat the many roundabouts,the Tenderloins forever unnamed.Even the sounds of the half-painted trams remain silentin passing. Their wheels grinding yet silent. The rainsilent. The accusations even more silent,or the “friends” who never talk back, clouded in darkness.The landscapes drifting.The equestrian trots drifting.All the genres mixed up or simply misplaced.The memories gone blank.The mundane measured in hours, minutes, or decades, intervening, descending.
