
nun meets me at the station,    first month with carol and
dick reynolds.  set the table.  clean the kitchen.  vacuum.thank god she didn't ask me to take care of the children.
i dry  dishes in the afternoon.   watch her can apples from
the backyard, put them in the cellar dark to save for winter.why is everything so quiet?   why does the man come home
from school everyday at 3:30 and read the paper?   why a
different casserole on the table every night and everyone
eats one portion and one portion only?  why is there always
enough, but never too much. . .
