Every written word is a suicide note.And a love letter, too.There may be no one to talk to who would get it,but if you write it down maybe someone will get it after you’ve left the room,or in five hundred years, or maybe someone from Sirius, the Dog Star,will get it. The composer Karlheinz Stockhausenclaimed he was born on Sirius. You remember him:the genius who said the crashing of planesinto the World Trade Center was the greatest concert ever held,although he later conceded the audience had not been given the optionto not attendand that somewhat diminished its perfection.I heard Stockhausen interviewed at Davies Symphony Hallbefore the orchestra played one of   his worksthat sounded to me like the voices of   the parentsin A Charlie Brown Christmas if they’d been arguing about real estate.No, I was not impressed by Karlheinz.His daughter Christel was a flautist in the orchestra,and she joined him for the interviewand said her father would take her and her brother out on the lawnof their summer house outside Cologne(this was years before he was on the cover of   Sgt. Pepper)and teach them to read each constellationas notes on a stave and to singthe words of their favorite nursery rhymes to the stars’melody: “The dog ran away in the snow” and“Go get the sleigh in the cellar.” It was a gamebut it was hard: work and play at once.Their father explained to them,“God does not write catchy tunes.”You could tell she meant it to be a charming story,but the audience sat in silence.Suffer the little children.
