
I can only give you back what you imagine.I am a soulless man. When I take you into my mouth, it is not my mouth. It isan unlit pit, an aperture opened just enoughin the pinhole camera to capture the shade.I have caused you to rise up to me, and Ihave watched as you rose and waned.Our times together have been innumerable. Still,like a Capistrano swallow, you come back.You understand: I understand you. Understandeach jiggle and tug. Your pudgy, mercurial wad.I am simply a hand inexhaustible as yours could never be. You’re nevertheless prepared to shoot.If I could I’d finish you. Be more than just your rag.
