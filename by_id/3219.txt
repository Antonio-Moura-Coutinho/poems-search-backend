
It's too soon for the front porch swing.
No crocuses are opeing.
The wind is from the north and chill.No matter. Spring is here. I stillAm bound to sit and swing out thereAnd feel it in the evening air.
It's much too cold. The trees are lean
And leaflessâ€”not a sign of green.
It's foolishness to sit outside.The mockingbird has testified To spring's existence, and I seeThe buds are on the almond tree.I'm sure it's spring.
How do you know?I think a cricket told me so.
