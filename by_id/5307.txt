Protected from rustand more esoteric forms of corrosion.My father gave me a rosewood chess set when I turned twelve.I’d never felt so loved through and through, almost literally, as if  I were transparent —and it probably wasn’t love, just a lucky, last-minute guessat the toy store, which is probably what most love is, anyway.I took the set into my room, shut the door,determined to master every fork and zugzwang,that strange position where you’d be safeif only you didn’t have to make a move.Now I’d given myself a perfect gift. I imagined the gun at restin a velvet sack next to its dainty box of   bullets. I wouldn’t need many.And no sequined wrapping paper could have been more beautifulthan the brown waxed sheet the clerk had unrolledand cut along the steel edge in one long, smooth stroke.When I finally slit through the layers to open it,the paper was as delicate and rich as sheets of pastryin baklava, with a mass of dark chocolate in the center.I’d never touched a gun. I loved how perfectly its handle fitmy hand: centuries of engineering and designcoming together in the “unit,” and I knew it would work.Unlike toys, religious rituals, erotic techniques, and works of art,I could depend on it. The only other device I ownthat fulfills its function so well is my reading glasses,and I used a soft gray cloth just like the one I clean them withto wipe the oil from my fingertipsas I dropped the bullets one by oneinto the somber chambers. I just need to know it’s there,like the extra purse I keep hidden in the closetwith a money clip and a neatly folded change of clothes.I don’t need a class in safety or marksmanship.If I ever use it, it will be at close range.It may be the only way to get rid of the stranger inside.It may be the only wayto get inside someone I lovewhen every other route has been systematically barred.
