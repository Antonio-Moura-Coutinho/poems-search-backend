What the body might guess,what the hand requests,what language assumesbecomes amulet,which is to sayI am carrying your facein a locket in a boxto a virtual locationguarded by kestrels,suggesting the scene’sgeography of love and dirt,trees ripe with darknessand bones’ white luster.In the moonlit blue house,where snow won’t fallunless called upon,grace enters as requested,lands next to you, grasped,as if love were a reflexsimple as weather.
