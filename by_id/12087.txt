Matching wits we wound upjangling on a motelbureau in simultaneous alarm & ran down together to silence,Bide-a-Wee’s appointedguest in his sleep deceasedso far from home he didn’t knowa soul. A what? We heard  Gideons rustling in the drawer,& as we rifled the fellow’s bags before we fled, & fled, his time flew too,from his cuffs & collars flapping ahead.
