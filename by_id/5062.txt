Everyone flopped into the creelof the happy fisherman, everyone eaten.Every river is Lethean,so why should we care if it’s not the same river? I hatehow everything changes, treeto failing term paper, chatelaineto beheaded plotter, drug dealer to narc.The heart softening faster than cerealbut then hardening to a relicwhich turns into another lineof depressed poetry to reciteto the next eager traineeanxious to be more than lint.Going up, you’re also going down, so eitherway, as your mother said, Be nice.When she went in, she was very thin.Earth, air, fire, water, mother.Fish pulse slowly under the river ice.
