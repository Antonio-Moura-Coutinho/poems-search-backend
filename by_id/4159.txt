
I keep returning to John Constable’s Study of Clouds.Oil on cardboard,
six by seven and a half inches, it shows purple-graythunderheads,
one patch of blue, above low hills and two small trees flanked by shrubsin the left
foreground. A sketch en plein air, a half hour’s worth of work at most,it catches
exactly one scrap of sky and shifting sunlight on a blusteryday in 1820.
The year King George the Third died in Windsor Castle, blindand insane, the year
50,000 Scottish weavers went on strike and printed a proclamationcalling for a new
“provisional government.” Their leaders were caught, hanged, and thendecapitated
for good measure. This cloud study survived that history.Two minutes later,
the clouds would have taken on a different cast of light and shapejust like the thunderheads
now piling up above the Liffey. I hobble out of the Dublin City Gallery,take a bus to the river,
sit on a park bench with a ziplock bag of ice on my swollen knee. Its wet coldmakes the joint
ache. My body is breaking down, bone spur under the right kneecap.At fifty-eight,
I watch young men and women in black sweats run along the River Liffey —Abha na Life,
Anna Liffey, river that crosses the plains of Life. I envy them.Once I too could run
over the asphalt, almost without knowing I inhabited a bodywhose knees might seize up
and swell. I will not run again in this life. Cirrus and cumulonimbusscud across the blue
escutcheon of sky. Sun’s blazon through rain rampant, my life is a cloud studyfor some larger landscape
John Constable never got around to painting. It hangs in a gilded frame.People stare at it
before passing on to more important canvases, to Renoir’sLes Parapluies, women
and men opening shiny black umbrellas in a Paris park.There a mother shelters
her two daughters under an umbrella meant for one.The younger daughter
holds a wooden hoop she has been rolling along tamped dirt paths,whipping it with a stick
to keep it spinning, before the rain settled in. Renoir paintedthis small family
in his lush, impressionistic style. Five years later, after visitingItaly and studying
Piero della Francesca’s frescoes, he came back and finished the paintingin his new “manière aigre”
or harsh style. He handled the gray silk folds of the auburn-haired woman’s dresson the left as if they were
granite to be sculpted. She carries a market basket filledto the brim with shadow.
To approach old age, one needs a new, harsher style. Here, by the Liffey,mothers push screaming
infants in strollers. Five teenagers in blue jeans and bright yellow or green raincoatswalk by, joking, texting
on cell phones, smoking. One girl and her boy hang back, embrace, French-kissa long ten seconds.
Another boy shouts over his shoulder, “Get a room!” A pairof mute swans
preens and swims down the River Liffey, whose amber waters mirrorhow the clouds pass,
avalanche of cumulus that hangs forever on the burnishedunrippling surface
of my memory — vast sky surf, cloud after cloud cresting, breakingto be washed
away to blue nothing. Each of us — lovers, mothers, runners, me — no morethan windblown swansdown.
