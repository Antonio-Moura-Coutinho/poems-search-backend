
We thought nothing of it, he says,though some came so close to where we slept.
I try to see him as a boy,
back in the Philippines, waking
to the sound of machine guns.
His family would spend their morningspreading a paste over the sores 
of the house’s thick walls.He tells how he touched 
points where bullets entered,his fingers, he says, disappeared into the holes,
as if inside there existed a space
where everything from this world could vanish.Here we could place the memory of my sister, 
his daughter, who died after a car wreck.Wedge her into the smoky path
                                                 & cover her in sunlight.The family next door is raking leaves in the yard.A father scolds his children for jumping
into large piles he arranged into a crescent moon.We cannot hear them from inside,
but I feel they are frightened as he grabs both of them
                                                            around the waist & spins.I wait for the ending to my father’s story,
but he is too busy smiling, as if enjoying the silenceof bullets frozen there in his mind.
