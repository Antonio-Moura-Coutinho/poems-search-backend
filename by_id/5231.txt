Breathing’s generally wary,Labored, as they say, whenThe end is at hand.But this is the everyday intakeOf   the imperceptible life force,Willed now, slow —Well, just cautiousIn inhabited air.As for ongoing dialogue,No longer an exuberant plosiveTo make a point,But a new squirreling of air space,A new sense of   boundary.Genghis Khan said the handIs the first thing one man givesTo another. Not in this war.A gesture of   limited distanceNow suffices, a nod,A minor smile or a handSlightly raised,Not in search of   its counterpart,Just a warning withinThe acknowledgment to stand back.Each beautiful stranger a barbarianBreathing on the other side of the gate.
