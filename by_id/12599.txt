
MY future will not copy fair my pastOn any leaf but Heaven's. Be fully done,Supernal Will ! I would not fain be oneWho, satisfying thirst and breaking fastUpon the fulness of the heart, at lastSaith no grace after meat. My wine hath runIndeed out of my cup, and there is noneTo gather up the bread of my repastScattered and trampled ! Yet I find some goodIn earth's green herbs, and streams that bubble upClear from the darkling ground, â€” content untilI sit with angels before better food.Dear Christ ! when thy new vintage fills my cup,This hand shall shake no more, nor that wine spill.
