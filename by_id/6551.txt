
Liebe, meine liebe, I had not hoped
to be so poor
                   The night winds reach
like the blind breath of the world
in a rhythm without mind, gusting and beating
as if to destroy us, battering our poverty
and all the land’s flat and cold and dark
under iron snow
                        the dog leaps in the wind
barking, maddened with winter, and his voice
claps again and again down the valley
like tatters of revolutionary pennants
                                                         birches
cry and hemlocks by the brook
stand hunched and downcast with their hands
in their pockets
Liebe, the world is wild
and without intention
                               how far
this might be from the night of Christmas
if it were not for you.
Down the reaching wind
shrieks of starlight bear broken messages
among mountains where shadows plunge
                                                      yet our brightness
is unwavering
                   Kennst du das land
wo die zitronen blühn, im dunkeln laub
die goldorangen ... liebe
