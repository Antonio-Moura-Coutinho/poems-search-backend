The slung belly pumpingas he panted and began to roar. His ballssheathed in fur swaying a little. His tail’s tuftjerking in an arc like an old-time pump handlerusted in midair. Somebody or somethingI read once said that when Jesus had his visionof what his father, God, would do to him,that Jesus could only see pieces of a cross,pieces of a body appearing through flashesof sun, as if the body in his visionwas hands looking for feet, a head for a torso,everything come unmagnetized from the soul:the lion caught me in his stare not ator through me but fixated on the great chainof being that Jesus couldn’t see and thata zebra might gallop in — black and white stripesmarking longitudes of this world turningto meat, bloody meat — this vision of an inmatethat Jesus’s father helped to orchestrate bymaking a cageless cage with glass insteadof bars — though the lion didn’t seem to care,he was roaring for his keepers to bringhim food, so everything’s what it should beif you’re a lion. Nor did the sea lionseem concerned about having gone a littlecrazy, barking incessantly so I could seethe plush, hot pink insides of its throat,though like the lion through the glassthere’s this distortion, my reflectionI’m looking through that makes me float abovethe zoo: and now this silence at closing timepours like a waterfall in different zonesof silences that, pouring through my head,surround roaring, barking, human muttering — is any of that what being sounds like?Or is it just animal gasping like whatJesus must have heard from the thieveshanging beside him, one damned, one saved?What was in his heart when his visionclarified and he saw it was a hand herecognized that the nail was driving through?
