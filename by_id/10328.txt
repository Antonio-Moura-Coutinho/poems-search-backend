
If a fairy should come from BabylandWith a smile on his face and a wand in his hand,And say to me in his merry way,“I wish to hear what you have to say’Bout being born all over again—Exactly where and exactly whenAnd just what kind of a feller you’d likeTo have for your dad on this earthly hike,”I’d look at him and try to be As nonchalant and gay as he,And then I’d say, “If I must beBorn again, it seems to me,It doesn’t matter much just where or when(For what’s a baby now and then?)But there’s one thing I must requestSo will you do your level bestAnd kindly see that I shall dropInto the self-same arms of the self-same Pop?For, take it from me, he’s the very best dadThat any baby’s ever had!”
