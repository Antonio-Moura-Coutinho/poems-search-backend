
It's never enough being one. Why do I hopeto contain you: always undoing and undone;every place you touch me changes shape.It's not my way to just lie down;to sink, effaced and full. If you swallow me, you're drained, and halfof us is gone. Desire's fulfillment is two,not one, or our tidal meetings are through.So hurl your wet force forward, sea,take me wave by wave. Pearl maker, pullme deep; our one's a need, a momentarybliss. What I erect, you spillâ€” castles, boulders, cliffs. My love's endurancegrain by grain; your adoration's rain.Touch my bones, my canyon's carved evidence.Even the moon who moves you is stone.
