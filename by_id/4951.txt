We built a fake estate.Levinas said to see ourselves we need each other yetdoorbells, rows of them, glow in the night villagea string of lit invitations no elbow has leaned into(both arms embracing messages). Unansweredthe doors are rotting from the bottom up.It’s another perplexing pothole in our road, loves.Hard core from the quarry might make it level,hard core and cunning speculation into mattersconcerning love and doubt, concerning want and plenty.O the places where pavement runs out and ragwortsprings up, where Lindenwood ends but doesn’t abutanywhere neatly, a petered-out plot of Tayto tumbleweeds, bin bags, rebar, roof slates, offcuts,guttering, drain grilles, doodads, infill, gravel!A not-as-yet nice establishment, possessing potentialwhere we have no authorized voice but are oddly fittedout for the pain it takes to build bit by bit.When the last contractions brought us to the brinkof our new predicament, we became developers.
