
You wanted to be a butcherbut they made you be a lawyer.You brought home presentswhen it was nobody’s birthday.Smashed platters of meatshe cut against the grain.Were a kind
 of portable shrine —   I was supposed to cultivate a field of  bliss, then return to my ordinary mind. You burned the filesand moved the office.Made your children feara different school.Liked your butter hardand your candy frozen.Were a kind
of diamond drill, drilling a hole right through my skull —   quality sleep, late November. What did it mean, “field of bliss” — A sky alive “with your greatest mentor” — I wore your shoes, big as boats,
flopped through the house —  while you made garlic eggs with garlic salt, what  “represents the living teaching” —  Sausages on toasted rye with a pickle, and a smother of cheese, and frosting
right out of  the can without the cake —  You ruled
with a knife in one hand and a fork in the other, you raged at my stony mother, while I banged   from my high chair, waving the bloodied bone   of something slaughtered — I was a butcher’s daughter. So all hail to me —  Os Gurges, Vortex Mouth, I gap my craw and the bakeries of the cities fall, I   stomp the docks — spew out a bullet stream of oyster shells, I’ll  drain the seas — the silos on every farm, the rice  from the paddy fields, the fruit from all the orchard trees, and then I’ll  eat the trees —   I’ll eat with money and I’ll eat with my teeth until the rocks   and the mountains curl and my blood sings —   I’m such a good girl   to eat the world.
