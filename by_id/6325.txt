Is there no when where this dream will rest?Blue smoke, wings, a plague
of  walls, the city motionless, massof mind and angst rising
in the brilliance of a cloudless light[le ciel, c’est mauve comme la lavande].
Everything turns in the quiet leisure of disaster:a kind of innocence
now supernatural darkness floating,trees shaking, waterways
swollen under a livid sky, storm cloudsforming in the blink of an eye.
The thought of you is performative: blondehair, pale complexion, downcast
jewels for eyes. Your dreadful martyrdomruns its course, written in mud
and butter: the human instant, in whichyou sing yourself full-throated.
Honey, ginger, flared saffron, graywhitemomentous rhythm of sea,
barbarous smell of wet earth, ransackingor ravaged flowers, the landfill
site, shit-hole, killing ground from which we supas shaking, hiccuping drunks.
To forfeit wisdom, atone for sins undone:the allegorical
hand thrust into torture, noise, shadowsof men. Between the lines,
against the clock, this does not make,does not make a difference to them.
This age [our age] demands an image of itsaccelerated grimace — 
an old bitch gone in the teeth, the ultimatecunt — our botched
civilization, our grave in the sky: last jizzof consciousness.
I could have, now, blown my fucking brains out,but for a sweet shimmer of reason,
blood, lone bells in gritty belfries, the shallowsof the sea, the surprise of days
which slide under sunlight, the soulgathered up, exhaled as rings of smoke.
Clay is the word and clay is the flesh. Youdrape your body against
my body, like a sheet of mirrored glass;you remain, comme le ditFlaubert, melancholique devant son rêve accompli. — The word “red” is not.
Forever in lust, forever in heat of fire and flood.Mule-bray, pig-grunt, bawdy
cackle and the stomping of feet to the beatof some undone family portrait
— bad teeth, bad eyes, beer and paint cans — the name and date split in soft slate.
Money makes an inverse differenceto distance, when I lift her back
to me now: nothing there but that palecurly head, working
a machine up and down, an ochreautumn merging into twilight.
I read much of the night. Guns click and spitand split up timber, until
the river’s tent is broken: old kettles, oldbottles, a broken can, old iron,
old bones, old rags, that raving slutwho kept the till.
Dreams nourished with tears, the sweet kinksof fists, light rain falling as mist.
The hours after you are gone are a leadwhite morning of  hard, new ice,
the snow drift of that which is left unspoken.Care and great sadness are both a burden.
No gods, but a black swastika and no skybut grinding water, gasping
wind, the wares of carthage, girlswith peacock eyes. The churn
of stale words staining the heart again:bleached wood massed as bones.
Your body is white as anemone petals,your skin is stone smooth, we
[as cold as the dead they loadlike a pile of  baskets, mound
of refuse, the sweepings of a street]are pressed close together, swaying.
Merely the despaired occasion of wordshedmade keener by blessed rage.
Scrape away the prison coating, the itchysea; drink from this glass
of pure, real, resplendent blood, itsmalediction, freshly soiled and snug.
It’s a question of altitude, probably, walkingalong your eyelid again, towards
your tear duct. This dance of firethat touches our lips, scorches
our tongues and pulls out the thinbeaten tin of my squally voice.
O technosociety, where memory is tolerated,barely, as real estate
on which to mount steeples of rust, layfresh mowed grass, burn gasoline:
anything so long as there’s a marginand little but commerce between us.
We never have pure space in front of us, rather:slight bondage, the world’s halter,
this fashion for dressing or setting our hairablaze until we’re ash and ash
in the heat of a blank but infinitely scrollingscreen, flared back to scratch.
We begin and end with a groan, the tongue’scomfortable wetness, sureness
of soul and fluttering lips. Then:lords of unquiet, quiet sojourn,
each atom which belongs to youbelongs to me.
All abandoned, the last rig broken, the staggeringshadows of trees, fence posts, gutted
cars, faces blurred and Sienese grave.I wish that I could speak only
of  it all, the voices of children singing.A chapel, in spite of  it all.
