
Death is comingand you must build a starshipto take you to Venus.Make it from a catsup bottle,a flashlight coil,a penny, the cat’s bell,Mom’s charm bracelet.They say that planet is torment,whipped by circular wind,choked in vitriol clouds.But no. When you get thereit is a light in the skyand I am with you.If you find nothing else,borrow the pleated wingof a winter moth,lighter than dust.
