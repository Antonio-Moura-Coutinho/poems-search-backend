
  The Butcher’s Apprentice, 1911–1914 by August Sander  The high white collar and the bowler hat,The black coat of respectability,The starched cuff and the brandished cigaretteAre what he has decided we will see,Though in the closet hangs an apron fleckedWith bits of  brain beside the rubber bootsStained brown from wading through the bloody slickThat by the end of every workday coatsThe killing floor he stands on. He declinesTo illustrate as in a children’s bookThe work he does, although it will defineHim every time the photograph he tookIs shown and captioned for posterity —Even as his proud eyes and carriage sayThat what he is is not what he would be,In a just world where no one had to slay.
