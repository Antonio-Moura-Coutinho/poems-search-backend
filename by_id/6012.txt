
The meek inherit nothing.God in his tattered coatthis morning, a quiet tonguein my ear, begging for alms,cold hands reaching up my skirt.Little lamb, paupered flock,bless my black tea with tears.I have shorn your goldenfleece, worn vast spoolsof white lace, glittering jacquard,gilded fig leaves, jeweled duston my skin. Cornsilk hairin my hems. I have milkedthe stout beast of what you call America;and wear your men across my chestlike furs. Stickpin fox and snowblue chinchilla: they too cameto nibble at my door,the soft pink tangles I trapthem in. Dear watchers in the shadows,dear thick-thighed fiends. At ease,please. Tell the hounds who undressme with their eyes — I have nothingto hide. I will spread myselfwide. Here, a flash of muscle. Here,some blood in the hunt. Now the centerof the world: my incandescent cunt.All hail the dark blooms of amaryllisand the wild pink Damascus,my sweet Aphrodite unfoldingin the kink. All hail hot jasminein the night; thick syrupin your mouth, forked daggeron my tongue. Legions at my heel.Here at the world’s red mecca,kneel. Here Eden, here Bethlehem,here in the cradle of Thebes,a towering sphinx roams the garden,her wet dawn devouring.
