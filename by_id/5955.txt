
Calláte. Don’t say it out loud: the color of his hair,the sour odor of his skin, the way they sayhis stomach rose when he slept. I havedone nothing, said nothing. I piss in the cornerof the room, the outhouse is far, I thinkorange blossoms call me to eat them. I fling rocksat bats hanging midway up almond trees.I’ve skinned lizards. I’ve been bored. It’s likethat time I told my friend Luz to rub her liceagainst my hair. I wanted to wear a plastic bag,to smell of gasoline, to shave my hair, to feelsomething like his hands on my head.When I clutch pillows, I think of him. If he sleepsfacedown like I do. If he can tie stringsto the backs of dragonflies. I’ve heardof how I used to run to him. His hair stillsmelling of fish, gasoline, and seaweed. It’s howI learned to walk they say. Calláte. If I stepout this door, I want to know nothing will take me.Not the van he ran to. Not the man he paid to take him.Mamá Pati was asleep when he left. People saysomehow I walked across our cornfieldat dawn, a few steps behind. I must have seen himget in that van. I was two. I sat behind a ceiba tree,waiting. No one could find me.
