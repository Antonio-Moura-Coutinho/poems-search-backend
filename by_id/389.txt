
That sound Arvo Pärt does with one piano note
stars split, fade, wander
in cosmic expansion—
 
First responder’s genesis and torch of
metadatacrunch tumbling in a 
burnt and weedy churchyard
equal parts Lethe and lithe—
Grass, is it hollow, hallow
to wake no longer among
mortals? The woman her dress flowered
from a blown ceiling silver-rosed—
Flat plasm’s
archangel coming clear out
of sheetrock and screen
shield and spear in hand
let us do all the cooking 
if she will lead the pack, remember the route, read the waters—
After the great fire we
tread river’s late cream and flare.
We woke in a city.
Where who slew us into portions
on a block out of earth
gathered our limbs 
and we were allowed to continue 
unhunted. If “if” is the one word one is given with God 
to explain how one survived.
Oh.  Ah.  Siren,
white cockatoo
meets deep
blue. 
Fog.  Pour ammonia
on coyote 
scat.
