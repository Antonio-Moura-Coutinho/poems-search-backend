
My bands of silk and miniverMomently grew heavier;The black gauze was beggarly thin;The ermine muffled mouth and chin;I could not suck the moonlight in.Harlequin in lozengesOf love and hate, I walked in theseStriped and ragged rigmaroles;Along the pavement my footsolesTrod warily on living coals.Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,In their corrupt disguises clothed,Morality I could not tearFrom my ribs, to leave them bareIvory in silver air.There I walked, and there I raged;The spiritual savage cagedWithin my skeleton, raged afreshTo feel, behind a carnal mesh,The clean bones crying in the flesh.
