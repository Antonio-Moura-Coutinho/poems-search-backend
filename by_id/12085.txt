The man is watching the road, listening,his own more diffuse unhappiness in abeyance,and because, in the restaurant before the filmthe woman had been describing the end of her marriageand cried, they are not sure whether they are in the theateror on the mountain road, and when the timber truckcomes suddenly around the bend, they both flinch.                            *     *     * He found that it was no good trying to tellwhat happened that day. Everything he saidseemed fictional the moment that he said it,the rain, the scent of her hair, what she saidas she was leaving, and why it was importantfor him to explain that the car had been parkedunder eucalyptus on a hillside, and how velvetyand blurred the trees looked through the windshield;not, he said, that making fictions might not bethe best way of getting at it, but that nothing he saidhad the brute, abject, unassimilated qualityof a wounding experience: the ego in any tellingwas already seeing itself as a character, and a character,he said, was exactly what he was not at that moment,even as he kept wanting to explain to someone,to whomever would listen, that she had closed the doorso quietly and so firmly that the beads of rainon the side window didn’t even quiver.                            *     *     * Names for involuntary movements of the body—squirm, wince, flinch, and shudder—sound like a law firm in Dickens:“Mr. Flinch took off his black glovesas if he were skinning his hands.”“Quiver dipped the nib of his peninto the throat of the inkwell.”                            *     *     * The receptionist at the hospital morgue told himto call the city medical examiner’s office,but you only got a recorded voice on weekends.                            *     *     *Setup without the punchline:Three greenhorns are being measured for suitsby a very large tailor on Hester Street.                            *     *     *Once there were two sisters called Knock Me and Sock Me;their best friend was a bear named Always Arguing.What kind of animals were the sisters? one child asked.Maybe they could be raccoons, said the other.Or pandas, said the first. They could be pandas.                            *     *     *“Why?” he asked. “Because she was lonely,and angry,” said the friendwho knew her better,“and she’d run out of stories.Or come to the one story.”                            *     *     *It is good to sit down to birthday cakewith children, who think it is the entire pointof life and who, therefore, respect each detailof the ceremony. There ought to be a rule,he thought, for who gets to lick the knifethat cuts the cake and the rule should haveits pattern somewhere in the winter stars.Which do you add to the tea first, he’d asked,the sugar or the milk? And the child had said,instantly: “The milk.” (Laws as cooland angular as words: angular, sidereal.)                            *     *     *Stories about the distribution of wealth:Once upon a time there was an old manand an old women who were very, very poor.                            *     *     *How Eldie Got Her NameThe neighborhood had been so dangerous,she said, there was one summer when the mailmenrefused to deliver the mail. Her mothernever appeared and her grandmother,who had bought a handgun for protectionand had also taught her how to use it,would walk her to the post office for the sweet,singsong, half-rhymed letters that smelled,or that she imagined smelled, of Florida.She had, when she was ten, shot at an intruderclimbing in the window. The roar,she said, was tremendous and she doesn’t knowto this day whether she hit the man or not.(A big-boned young woman, skin the colorof the inside of some light-colored hazelnutconfection, auburn eyes, some plucked stringof melancholy radiating from her whole bodywhen she spoke.) Did her mama come back?They had asked. She never came back.The mail started up again but the letters stopped.Turned out she was good in school, and thatwas what saved her. She loved the laborof schoolwork. Loved finishing a projectand contemplating the neatness of her script.Her grandmother shook her head, sometimes,amused and proud, and called her “Little Diligence.”                            *     *     *Punchline without the setup:And the three nuns from Immaculate Conceptionnodded and smiled as they passed,because they thought he was addressing them in Latin.                            *     *     *He had known, as long as he’d known anything,that he had a father somewhere. When he was twelve,his mother told him why he had no shadow.                            *     *     *Because she, not her sister, answered the door,she was the first to hear the news.                            *     *     *A Ballad:He loved to watch that woman sew.She let her hair grow long for show.Riddle’s a needle (a refrain might go)and plainly said is thread.                            *     *     *She looked beautiful, and looked her age, too.She’d had a go at putting herself together;she had always had the confidence that,with a face like hers, a few touchesto represent the idea of a put-together lookwould do, like some set designer’s geniusminimalism. It had a slightly harridan effectand he remembered that it wasn’t what washeadlong or slapdash about her, but the waythey gestured, like a quotation, at an understandingof elegance it would have been boring to spell out,that had at first dazzled him about her.He felt himself stirring at this recognition,and at a certain memory that attended it,and then laughed at the thought that he hadactually stimulated himself with an analysisof her style, and she said, as if she were rememberingthe way he could make her insecure, “What?What are you smiling about?” and he said, “Nothing.”And she said, “Oh, yes. Right. I remember nothing.”                            *     *     *Two jokes walk into a bar.A cage went in search of a bird.A boy walks out in the morning with a gun.Three rabbis walk into a penguin.                            *     *     *In the other world the girls were named Eleanor and Filina,and one night it was very warm and they could not sleepfor the heat and the stillness, and they went outside,beyond the wall of their parents’ garden and into a meadow.It was a dark night, moonless, and the stars were so thickthey seemed to shudder, and the sisters stood a long timein the sweet smell of the cooling grasses, looking at the skyand listening in the silence. After a while they heard a stirringand saw that a pair of bright eyes was watching themfrom the woods’ edge. “Maybe it’s their friend, the bear,”one of the children said. “I don’t like this story,” said the other.
