the stranger two rows back, that fragile
chance you’ll forget in the second trailer.
 
Now it’s quiet, still
this burden of being watcher and screen
and what floats across it–light pouring out
 
its time and necklines and train wrecks.
What a relief to yield to the EXIT
sign red “I” blinking like a candle.
 
Soon the enormous figures moving
across rooms, the emphatic narrative
arcs. (There’s the thrum of the subway,
 
its engine of extras.) Here now
the beginning of trivia tests. Warning puppets
with brown-bag faces and fringy hair.
 
You’re almost here. But what you want
is the after. How yourself you are now
walking into the night, full moon over Houston Street,
 
at the bright fruit stand touching the yellow
mums. Here you are: Woman with Cilantro
listening to the rattle of the wrap,
 
the paper sound paper makes after you
have heard movie paper. Apples are more apples.
Paper more paper. Cilantro, its sweaty green self.
