A passing skiffStartles a lone gravenche in Switzerland,Just as a pair of blue pike swerveTo avoid an anchor. The harelip suckerStays on course. A phantom shinerMight have swerved to snap up a three-tooth caddisfly,Or even Blackburn’s weevil, but it’s hard to tellWhy the white-winged sandpiper wheelsAt the distant warble of a black-footed parakeet.Gould’s emerald has a tiny, ferocious heart.Domed Mauritius tortoises are clannish,Often clashing with saddle-backed Mauritius tortoises,Though the saddle-backed Rodrigues tortoiseEnjoys friendly relations with the domed Rodrigues tortoise.The Santa Fe Island tortoise keeps to itself, broodingOver its sufferings. The Japanese wolf sniffs the air.The Tasmanian wolf bursts into a sprint,The Arabian ostrich could outpace a sprinting bicyclist,And the legs of the sprinting red gazelle blur beneath it,Like the rapidly beating wings of the Kosrae crake.The Kosrae starling is nesting. In one treeThe Cascade funnel-web spider lays a trap,While in another, the American chestnut mothSleeps fitfully. The dodo is too trusting.The laughing owl can be heard across the island.The roar of the Caspian tiger resounds in a canyon.Children shudder at the sound of the Bombay lion.But not even the Caribbean monk sealHears the Caribbean monk seal mite silently makeIts home in the manner of the passenger pigeon mite,Burrowing into the ear canal. The warm river water Through which the Durango shiner dartsReflects a spectacled cormorant. On drafts of airA dusky seaside sparrow rises. Its shadow fallsOn a school of stumptooth minnows. The sunlightBarely filters down to a Bodensee-kilch,But a red-headed green macaw glimmers.The Kona grosbeak filches fruit from volcanoesSloping down to the shore where Galápagos damselsFrolic and spawn. The bezoule makes a rareAppearance. Heath hens gather by the pond.Only when the North Island giant moa starts to wonderAbout what happened to the South Island giant moaDoes the upland moa give any thoughtTo the whereabouts of the eastern moa. Meanwhile,The coastal moa seems to have gone offAfter the heavy-footed moa, which followsIn its turn the tracks of the crested moa,Wandering the islands looking for Mantell’s moa.None of them have seen a bush moa in a while.Even as the quagga poses for its photograph,The St. Croix racer is slithering out of the frameIn eager pursuit of a big-eared hopping mouse.This may be the moment the Queen of Sheba’s gazelleTakes its leave, along with the Atlas bear,The Palestinian painted frog, and several others.The aurochs left long ago. The lapping wavesEcho the strokes of the sea mink, but likeThe Japanese river otter, it’s nowhereTo be seen. What will the confused moth do?The same as Darwin’s rice rat. Years go by,And the Martinique macaw flies through none of them.Melville might have encountered a Nuka Hiva monarch,But Nabokov never pinned a Xerces blue.Cloned, the Pyrenean ibex livedA few seconds more. The paradise parrotSported the spectrum on its plumage. BluebucksOnly looked blue while alive. The Miller’s railSurvives in a painting. Labrador ducks ate mussels.The crescent nail-tail wallaby once was common.The thylacine appeared four million years ago.Rats killed off the mysterious starling.
