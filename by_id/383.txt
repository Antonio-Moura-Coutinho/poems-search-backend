
In a patch of sunlight
a decapitated grasshopper
twitches. The sunlight twitches.
Sky the size of a sky imagined.
 
Squint to see the quarter moon
—shallow gash on blue horizon.
Squint to hear beyond windows
wafting muzak. I’m half-awake
 
in this field of turned-on particulars.
A wreck of yellow blossoms
under a barn-door window.
 
A barn door without the barn.
