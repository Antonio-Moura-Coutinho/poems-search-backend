The We won’t be here too long  ...    Do not step off  ...The carousel? Do you recall? As ifwe were our own young parents suffering againafter so many hundreds of hours of bliss. And even the startling fact that what had always been feared might come to pass: A familiar sweater in a garbage can.A surgeon bent over our baby, wearing a mask. But surely you recall how happily and for how longwe watched our pretty hostages go round. They waved at us too many times to count.Their dancing foals. Their lacquered mares. Even a blue-eyed hunting hound was still allowed back then.
