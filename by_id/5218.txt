
An unexpected consequenceOf mine (and one that shows how wellIt really went, in a scary sense)Is at its most perceptibleWhen I happen to observe a noseWith the hump of  which my nose is rid(Though not my psyche, you’d suppose)And feel the sighting visitedBy what a lord might call a kindOf  pity: distant, tinged with scorn...A thing you’d more expect to findIn someone to his beauty born.
