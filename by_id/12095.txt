After forty years rebuilding,the Old Town is like this beautiful girl I knewwhose face was wheel-broken in a crash,and remade so well it was hard to say howshe looked wrong. I’d brought two questions here—holding them as if they might slip: who weremy mother’s people? Where did they die?In an attic-archive—deep card indexes, ink turned lilacwith age—I handed my questions to a love-laborerin a yarmulke; with sad palms and a shakeof the head he regretted that any answers nowlay probably beyond our reach. SoI abandoned questing and went back to tourism;joined the passeggiata, drank black tea, got stickiedunder sooty lime trees, saw boisterous children,all knees and elbows, skyline-caperingon the wall at the river-divide. Beyondtheir frail silhouettes against the petrol duskhuge cranes were moving, courtly, confident,building another new Warsaw across the Vistula.
