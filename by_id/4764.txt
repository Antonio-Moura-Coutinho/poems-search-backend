Or how from Adam’s rib was fashioned Eve—bone of his own bone, flesh of his flesh—whom he got gravid by implanting seed,in her unfathomably fecund Eden.The memory of a woman’s companywould bring his ambulations to a haltto aim his gaping face due heavenward, the dewy air her touch, her taste, sweet salt.
