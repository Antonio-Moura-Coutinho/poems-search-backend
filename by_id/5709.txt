(Some sort of permanence that works in the way I work — water, light, a finger touch confirming my edges.)I only have cats to verify I’m there. • I am building up evidence. Some bodily. Some constructed.On balance, perhaps I am more a person who racks upindicators of taste as proof of living. There are condiments,playlists, preferred linens. I first got drunkon Cinzano. There was no one taking notes. I used to dreamof sex in a fully upholstered room with no windows or doors.This idea of rabbit fur rugs and buttoned velvet cushions,immaculately conceived. Always snagged on the detailof things — how even did I come to be inside,nevermind out. The sex wasn’t the point. What I seekis magic like an intact lipstick mirror in an antique handbag,my own nifty (crackerjack?) endurance. Or to discovera gulping heart within a privet hedge. Or the druzy quartzof someone’s eyes long gone and to say it!• I am dying to be written about in your diaryand my self-involvement extends to endlessphotographs of my eye makeup, which might be describedas “signature.” FYI I prefer a fine brush to a pen.What can be said about slush, about the corners cut when cleaningthe fridge. What can be said about what is consideredto be ordinary. Crucially, love is a desireto be a witness and be witnessed, how you might skatepast the provisional. If the house were burning downI would rescue all the photographs
