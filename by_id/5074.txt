
It seems to head from its last stop too fast,my transbay train’s strung-out hoo, deepinside the tunnel, and starts to bleedinto the baritone wail of that guyat platform’s end, a sort of lullabyrubbed against the wall then caught in a squallof wind darkening toward us, his whippy voiceskinning its tired song off the tiled dome:he’s determined, the silky lyric says,to be independently blue, while we allwait to be chuted to car lot or home,closer to love, or farther, and sooner to loss,our bashful shoes and arms like lives crossed,every plural presence now some thing alone,thanks to our singer-man. We wait for the train,patient with hope, a hope that’s like complaint.
