
O awaken with methe inquiring goodbyes.Ooh what a messy businessa tangle and a muddle(and made it seem quite interesting).He ticks them off:leisure top,a different ride home,whispering, in a way,whispered whiskers,so many of the things you have to share.But I was getting on,and that’s what you don’t need.I’m certainly sorry about scaring your king,if indeed that’s what happened to him.You get Peanuts and War and Peace,some in rags, some in jags, some invelvet gown. They wantthe other side of the printing plant.There were concerns.Say hi to jock itch, leadership principles,urinary incompetence.Take that, perfect pitch.And say a word for the president,for the scholar magazines, papers, a streaming.Then you are interested in poetry.
