She watched it move.Low and angular, not quite as catlikeas one might suppose, but still, it was him.She walked to the door, just like in the old days,and opened it, and met a whoosh of winter air.She waited. The bones in the glass case rattled.Then the cat-shadow darted at her,through her legs, and slipped outside.It mingled with the shadows of bare branches,and leapt at the shadow of a bird.She looked at the tree, but there was no bird.Then he blended into the shadow of a bush.She stood in the threshold, her hands on the door,the sharp breeze ruffling the faded flowersof her house dress, and she could feelher own bones rattling in her body,her own shadow trying to slip out.
