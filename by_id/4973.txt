And glad I’m not taking a test and running out of time.What’s a tetrahedron anyway? What’sthe sublime, 3,483 divided by 9,the tenth amendment, the ferryman’s nameon the River Styx? We’re all missingmore and more tricks, losing our grips,guilty of crimes we didn’t commit.The horse rears and races then moves no more,the sports coupe grinds to a stop, beginninga new life as rot, beaten to shit, Whitmangrass stain, consciousness swamp gas,the bones and brain, protoplasm and liver,ground down like stones in a river. Or doesthe heart’s cinder wash up as delta frothout of which hops frog spawn, dog song,the next rhyming grind, next kid literati?Maybe the world’s just a bubble, all philosophy ants in a muddle,an engine inside an elk’s skull on a pole.Maybe an angel’s long overdue and we’reall in trouble. Meanwhile thanks whoeverfor the dial turned to green downpour, thanksfor feathery conniptions at the seashoreand moth-minded, match-flash breath.Thank you for whatever’s left.
