I keepthe entrance hidden, no one seems to noticethe hours I’m missing  ...    I’llbring you one night, it’s whereI go when Ihang up the phone  ...                                          Neither younor your soul is waiting for me atthe end of this, I know that, the saltnearly clear after Ichisel out the pews, the see-throughaltar, the opaquepanes of glass that depict the stations ofour cross — Here is the daywe met, here is the day we remember wemet
