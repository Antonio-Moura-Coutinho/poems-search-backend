They’re mysignature looks. Body by Envy.Make up & wardrobe provided by Avarice. Lord,if you take away my inordinate cravings,what the hell’s left? Do you knowhow much I paid for my best rages?I want them all back if they’reso To Die For. Else shred my palms,wash my face with spit, let the whip unlace my flesh and free the naked blood, let me be tumbled to immortalitywith the stew of flood debristhat is my life.
