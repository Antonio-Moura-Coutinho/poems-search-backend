It takesa new footing some-where in the ribs’ treads, about heart- height, to climb it now. A new gap’s inthe smile that smilesfrom the limed barn floor. There seems to come a break in the war. But soon, oneof a neighbor’s sons, too young to know it was otherwise once, braves it, and soon, even with a sweater-swaddled kitten or a BB gun, all the kids can do it again, nearly at a run, like pros, andso it goes, as before.
