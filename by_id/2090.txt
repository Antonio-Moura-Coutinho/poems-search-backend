
Forsythia, scaled and bud-bangled,I pruned to a thatch of leavesfor the curb, by the squirrel-gnawedcorn, silk strewn, kernels tooth carvedand husks shorn over the groundpocked with paw prints.The borers mashed the squash vine,the drought tugged the roots of sage,catmint languished by the sidewalk,tools grew flowers of rust.That winter we left our hopebeneath the snow, loved through the lastof the onions, watched the late leeks freezeto crystal, bent like sedges, their shadowson the snow. That winter we leftour hope beneath the snow.
