Two billion outstretched Chinesehands, give or take a fewthousand amputees.A cheap knockoff, the nightproved to be — Noklanot Nokia on the touchscreen.Well, even Old Peng gotta eat,Confucius say. Or maybe thatwas Cassius Clay. In me, folks, a movable objectmeets a resistible force. I haven’t worked a day since the accidentof   birth. Born of  woman,my father the same. Make lovethen war. I’ll bring round the car.These children that I spit onare immune to my consultations.I’ll have none myself. It isn’t (Write it!) a fiasco. I am small, I contain platitudes.
