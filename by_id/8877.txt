I see you're already lower-casing him...Would you rather I...
What is this "I." You have none.Today's the rider's birthday.
Except he's dead.In a contrary mood today?
Not in the way you'd think.I'm you're friend, remember? And I can't hurt you. I have no body.
Neither does Krang.K-----?
The bodiless brain. The Ninja Turtles' nemesis. The guy who oversees
all of their activities.And yet you carry him in your pocket like a good luck charm. You perplex
your son who can't see the humor in your perversity because to him Krang is
just, to put it plainly, disgusting.
