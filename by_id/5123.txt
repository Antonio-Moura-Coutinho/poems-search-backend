
The day upturned, flooded with sunlight, nota single cloud. I squint into the glare,cautious even then of bright emptiness.We sit under shade, Tía Luciashowing me how white folks dine, the high life.I am about to try my first oyster,Tía spending her winnings from the slotson a whole dozen, the glistening valveswet and private as a cheek’s other side, broken open before us. Don’t be shy.Take it all in at once. Flesh and sea grit,sweet meat and brine, a taste I must acquire. In every split shell, the coast’s silhouette: bodies floating in what was once their home.
