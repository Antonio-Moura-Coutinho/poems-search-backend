I have typed out some abbreviated remainswhere my old life used to be, but I’m stillliving in them as if they were a book.I spent the afternoon revelingand wondering whatI need to do to get my own sheep.I saw sheep herding and shearing,admired the baby lambs, and followedthe “from sheep to sweater” interpretive trail.
