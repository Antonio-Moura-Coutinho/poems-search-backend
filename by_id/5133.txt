We’re thinking November—it keeps on happening again—and we’llneed heat. Now it’s still summer, too hot untilfall to turn off the AC. Considerthat other cloudless day, paying the billin City Hall. It’s way too high now, stillwe pay it. Look at the line, at him, her—it keeps on happening again and it will.Energy’s costly. We forget it can kill.Though some of our children can’t remember,we in the building paying the billlook at the date, at the window sill,think of their choice between jump and tinder.It keeps on happening again and it will.We’re in the tall building, paying the bill.
