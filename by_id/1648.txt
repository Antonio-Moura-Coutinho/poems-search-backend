        “Even when you are not in a room,         you are in it, your voice everywhere.”  –Bill HolmThe message that’s recorded on the phoneis unmistakably bad news, and thenanother call tells us it’s one we love—a sudden death while traveling, somehowappropriate for one who alwaysseized life too completely to stand still.A door slams shut, a wall has dropped away, and once again I’m driven back toempty pages, insufficient words,to rooms he always filled on entering—rooms lined with books, piano music, andgood friends who raise their glasses one last time.And now, as all the lights are blinking offin every prairie town we’ve ever loved,when all the toasts are made and songs are sung,when leaving is the only certainty,a single voice keeps echoing, alongeach dark, untraveled hallway of the heart.
