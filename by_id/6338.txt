i poured a bowl of cereal,
threw the empty box in the
trash can. granddaddy pulled
the box from the trash,
poured the crumbs into a
bowl, then doused the sand
in milk. he looked down at the
bowl, murmuring about how
he had survived the depression. told
a story about asking for hot water
at colored diners, how he would
pour ketchup in cups to make soup.
this was how
i first learned i am
             wasteful.

i would stand in the bathroom
with my mother. would ask her
why the water in the bowl was
red. she would tell me she
had eaten beets. i suppose
i was too young to learn
the truth, milkflowers
spill petals red.

in my catholic school of fish,
we took a beautifully wrapped box,
passed it around the class,
unwrapping it piece by piece.
afterwards it was cleverly
explained that the box is
a girl’s virginity
the gift we give our husbands.
& who wants a toy that has
already been opened? half
the joy is in untying the string.
this is how i was taught
that at my very core, i am
              ungrateful.

i met someone recently,
in an irish bar, who told me
it’s about knowing what i need.
he said laterwhat you need
is a wife
