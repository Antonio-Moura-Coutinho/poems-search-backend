
To all events I squirted youknowing this not to be this came to passwhen we were out and it looked good.Why wouldn’t you want a fresh pieceof outlook to stand in down the years?See, your house, a former human energy construction,crashed with us for a few days in Mayand sure enough, the polar inscapebrought about some easier poems,which I guessed was a good thing. At leastsome of us were relaxed, Steamboat Bill included.He didn’t drink nothing.It was one thingto be ready for their challenge, quite another to accept it.And if I had a piece of advice for you, this is it:Poke fun at balm, then suffer lethargyto irradiate its shallow flood in the new packagingour enemies processed. They should know.The Gold Dust Twins never stopped supplicating Hoosiersto limn the trail. There’s no Shakespeare.Through the window, Casanova.Couldn’t get to sleep in the dumb incidentof those days, crimping the frozen feet of Lincoln.
