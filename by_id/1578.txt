
I broke the spell that held me long,The dear, dear witchery of song.I said, the poet’s idle loreShall waste my prime of years no more,For Poetry, though heavenly born,Consorts with poverty and scorn.I broke the spell–nor deemed its powerCould fetter me another hour.Ah, thoughtless! how could I forgetIts causes were around me yet?For wheresoe’er I looked, the while,Was Nature’s everlasting smile.Still came and lingered on my sightOf flowers and streams the bloom and light,And glory of the stars and sun; –And these and poetry are one.They, ere the world had held me long,Recalled me to the love of song.
