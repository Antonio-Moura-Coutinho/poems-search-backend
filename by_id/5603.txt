
A sycamore grove, and in its limbsthe orchestra played Má vlast, so I sawboughs bouncing and tuxedo legsswinging sap-spotted above the splayedblades of the ground feathered blackin moss, in the sweat of the set sun,and the players’ faces where moths roosted,where leaf-points drew water-stripeson brows and eyelids, their handsthat stirred in pollen like a fog, were maskedby birds’ nests and bows and flaking vines.That you were last to climb down,trumpet tied to your back with blue twine,is the only thing I believe in,and after you landed, driftingthrough a stream, in a mat of orange needles,you whistled to what light could floatthrough the leaves’ screen and canopy, diffuselike tracing tissue, a scrum of benday dots,            and not much at that,now that more than the concert has ended,                            my musician.
