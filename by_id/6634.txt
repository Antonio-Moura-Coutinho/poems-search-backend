1
In the region of rain and cloud,
I live in shade,
under the moss mat of days bruised
                        purple with desire.
My dominion is a song in the wide ring of water.
There, I run to and fro,
braiding the logical act
            in the birth of an Ear of Corn,
polychromatic story I will now tell
in the weaving, power's form in motion,
a devotion to the unstressed.
Once, I wreathed around a king,
became a fishing net, a maze
               “a deadly wealth of robe.”
Mothers who have heard me sing take heart;
I always prick them into power.
2Y vengo alzando al viento la roja flor de invierno.
(I lift the red flower of winter into the wind.)
       —Poesía Náhuatl
