
This is where you leave me.Filling of old salt and ponderous,what’s left of your voice in the air.Blue honeycreeper thrashed outto a ragged wind, whole monthsspent crawling this white beachraked like a thumb, shucking, swallowingthe sea’s benediction, pearled oxides.Out here I am the body invented naked,woman emerging from cold seas, herselfthe raw eel-froth met beneath her tangles,who must believe with all her puckeringholes. What wounds the Poinciana slitsforth, what must turn red eventually.The talon-mouths undressing. The cling-clingbird scratching its one message; the armyou broke reset and broke again. Caribbean.Sky a wound I am licking, until I am drawn newas a lamb, helpless in the chicken wire of my sex.I let every stranger in. Watch men change faceswith the run-down sun, count firesin the loom-holes of their pickups, lines of rot,studying their scarred window-plagues,nightshade my own throat closed tightagainst a hard hand. Then all comes mutein my glittering eye. All is knocked back,slick hem-suck of the dark surf, ceramictiles approaching, the blur of a beard.The white tusk of his ocean goring me.This world unforgiving in its boundaries.The day’s owl and its omenslipping a bright hookinto my cheek —
