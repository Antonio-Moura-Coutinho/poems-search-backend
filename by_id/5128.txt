
The last two sherpas were the strongest,faithful companions, their faces wind-peeled,streaked with soot and glacier-light on the snowfieldbelow the summit where we stopped to rest.The first was my body, snug in its cap of lynx-fur, smelling of yak butter and fine mineral dirt,agile, impetuous, broad-shouldered,alive to the frozen bite of oxygen in the larynx.The second was my intellect, dour and thirsty, furrowing its fox-like brow, my calculating brainsearching for some cairn or chasm to explainmy decision to send them back without me.Looking down from the next, ax-cleft serac I saw them turn and dwindle and felt unafraid. Blind as a diamond, sun-pure and rarefied,whatever I was then, there was no turning back.
