
Because it is a pearly eveningI am sitting in the window readinga book I have read before.Branches emphasizetheir heft and sway over their shadows.Some kind of extra firmament,an ear over the earth's ear,extra, as language is to prayer.Narratives of elsewhere: in the eyeinside my eye that vision makes when you tell it towhen you shut your eyes so hard they hurtyou get more vista and less twistof road, and then you're lookingat a valley you named yourselfand irrigated yourself,full of bitterroot, magnolia in the cleftsof rock, sage, at last a harvest,a desert that belongs to youâ€”The trick to renunciation is starting now.The secret of detachmentis having already given up,a transcript of speech whose cadences are lost,the human need for a body to fill inall your body's deficiencies, those clefts and dentsalready given up, the narrative of a lifecompletely altered in the retrospectthat knowledge brings and so discreditedthe point of memory utterly lost.That piece of land has always beensuitable for a house. That nest has neverbeen ready for eight baby birdswho, top-heavy, frightened their own branchand home and scared themselvescompletely and remarkably away.Do you hear that? It's the wind negotiating the spine of one leaf it cannot decide whether to raise a fragment of an inch.Duncan writes as a readerstruggles with a strong sentence, I struggleat certain unmistakable timeswith what's furtive and most right.When people marry they finish their names.I am still listening for mineto begin. My spinewants a bicycle to order its work, a redbicycle, a hill into a heartof a city that holds something I want.The pattern of the air around that leafis like someone tracing my ribcagewith his index fingerand then walking away.Who can blame us for wanting other worlds,but shall we take them,or let them come to us? Is the spirit just an earmore like a mouththat bites the air and turns it into blood?A voice in the next room goes to sleep.Sleep moves in the branches of the oakbecome a rootless massunsung by skeleton or name or height.My friend who saysshe does not believe in Paradisebelieves in rest: I believe that,or more likely I like to think of her,the way she held my name in her small mouth,as she held her own name. I like to think of anyonewho on a night like thiswould reach towards my ribcageand trace it delicately and walk away.
