
Here where the rooms are dryly stillWho is this dustily asleepWhile juicy children run the field?Where is her ever deepening wellWhose buckets to a fullness dipFor needs compassion must fulfill?Like freshets they themselves may yieldA little to the turned up cup,But death is in the long dry spell.Run children, run, the light grows dull,And she who keeps the well must sleep,And rain is unpredictable.December 1951
