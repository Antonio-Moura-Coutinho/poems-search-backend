
Admit it — you wanted the end with a serpentine greed. How to negotiatethat strangling mist, the fibrouswhisper?To cease to exist and to dieare two different things entirely.But you knew this, didn’t you?Some days you knelt on coins in those yellow hours. You lit a flameto your shadow and atescorpions with your naked fingers.So touched by the sadness of hairin a dirty sink.The malevolent smell of soap.When instead of swallowing a fistfulof white pills,you decided to shower,the palm treesnodded in agreement,a choir of crickets singing behind your swollen eyes.The masked bird turned to you with a shred of paper hangingfrom its beak.At dusk, hair wet and fragrant,you cupped a goat’s faceand kissed his trembling horns. The ghost? It fell prostrate,passed through you like a swift and generous storm.
