The rock lives in the desert, solid, taking its time.The wave lives for an instant, stable in momentumat the edge of the sea, before it folds away.Everything that is, lives and has size.The mole sleeps in a hole of its making, and the hole also lives; absence is not nothing.It didnâ€™t desire to be, but now it breathesand makes a place, for the comfort of the mole.I am a space taken, and my absence will be shapelyand of a certain age, in the everlasting.In the fierce evening, on the mild day,How long shall I be shaken?(Habakkuk)
