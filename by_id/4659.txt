One dies.Eschrichtius
           robustus, gray,
           of the sole living genus, of  baleen,
of the family
Eschrichtiidae, slate
           gray or darker,
           and notable, now, for
gray-white patterned scars
left by parasites, two
           blowholes “which can
           create a distinctive
V-shaped
blow ... in calm wind conditions”;
           and falls, as
           it falls, as through blue breeze;
and swirls, light
as a tissue, drifting down—
           down, through
           the cool layers, the sifted light
of sea-wind-
warmed currents, loose galaxy
           of whirling flecks, slow-
           motion, in a haze;
in whose first stage, falling,
now, the “mobile
           scavengers” drift alongside,
           sleeper sharks
and thin hagfish
—or, as the book calls them,
           “enrichment opportunists”—
           come to feed
at the soft flanks and fat,
for weeks, as the
           bones grow exposed, all
           of them, spinning down ...

We might hear rain before the rain. Sirens.
Hail before it cracked the hundred panes.
Or lay our heads on the desks and listen
to our blood whispering in the woodgrain.
In 1963 the warnings are
piecemeal, part of the good day’s play or work.
We might need to cover our heads. Hold hands
in the hallway. Look away from the blast.

July 29, 2013: a sperm whale found deceased on the beach of
a small island off the coast of the Netherlands had dozens of
plastics bags, nine meters of rope, two long pieces of garden hose,
a couple of flower pots, and a plastic spray canister in its stomach.

I’m watching a hummingbird, bare thumb-
top—gray-green blur—dip to my feeder bulb
and dart off, over the barn, to a wire.A. colubrus. Little serpent. I hear
the burr of wings; and already it’s back—
dips again, hovers there; sips now; attacks
the tube of red sugar-water until
bubbles aerate, like an aneurism.

June 28, 2016: an 80-foot blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus)
caught in 200 feet of fishnet, crab lines, channel buoys off the
coast of Orange County: lines cut through its mouth, wrapped
its fins. “Blue whales are typically thought to be more offshore
animals, and crabbing gear is thought to be more inshore, but
obviously the spatial overlap between those two is coming into
conflict,” explained Leigh Torres. “The fact that we see this
entanglement isn’t terribly surprising, though it is unique.”

Weeks I couldn’t sleep. Years I couldn’t waken.
I found a note I’d written one ill night.pines shredded      ice snow
                                                 such wind
        rips the night
I run my tongue above my tooth, aching.
And know it’s coming back once more. The warning
—right cuspid, gum swollen, puffed as a pea—
two days before the viral fire, the toxic sea ...

March 23, 2016: 13 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus)
beached themselves off the shallow coast at Tönning, Germany:
“We may never know the exact cause,” wrote Danny Groves.
Stomach contents: 43 feet of fishing net, 100 plastic bags,
golf balls, sweatpants, greenhouse glass sheeting, cigarette
butts, hypodermic needles, a plastic car engine cover, a bucket ...

Cottonwood seeds. Gnats’ wings in the sunlight.
Whirl of dust motes in the haze of still light.
If it were so simple as to drift down.
If it were so easy as getting up again.
Little bug, little serpent. The air slows
with summer thickness when you fly away.
And the feeder bobs there like a red buoy
on the green waters of a distant bay.

             One of my titers read 2560

I have been silent for a long time now.
You know I am serious about the whales.
You don’t know this. I floated there in stillness,
in white sheets. White boughs breaking. The pines
in ice and wind like a hammering pulse.
When I woke I couldn’t speak or make sense.
And when I slept again I didn’t sleep.
And more fires spreading through the body’s depths.

“Plastic Garbage Patch Bigger Than Mexico Found in Pacific.”National Geographic: These pieces of plastic are not necessarily
floating bottles, bags, and buoys, but “teeny-tiny pieces of plastic resembling
confetti.” 90% of sea birds consume it. “Over eight million tons of new plastic
trash finding its way into the oceans every year.”
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch moves in a clockwise direction,
like a toilet. It circulates an area of 7.7 million square miles.
“70% of marine debris sinks to the bottom of the ocean.”New York Times: Plastiglomerate was “discovered” by Charles Moore,
a sea captain, surveying plastic washed up on a remote, polluted
stretch of sand on Hawaii’s Big Island. It is a new stone, a fusion
of natural and manufactured materials. “If [plastiglomerates] are
buried within the strata,” says Jan Zalasiewicz, an English geologist,
“I don’t see why they can’t persist in some form for millions of years.”

You’d think we’d learned enough to duck our heads.
(It’s time for arithmetic.) Okay, kids,
who can tell me what you get when you divide
a number by itself? Silence. Overhead
the hum of fluorescents. The swallowing sea
of storm clouds out the window beyond the trees.
What does it take to raise sufficient alarm?
When do you hide? Where do you fly from harm?

Aggregates increase “like snow.” Aggregation theory represents
a two-state system [“time for chemistry, kids”] ... to characterize
the formation of marine aggregates and the loss due to sinking:
 
  
where· C1 is the concentration of the cells· r is the radius of each cell· G is the shearing rate· α is the stickiness coefficient· g is the growth rate.
Thus, aggregation of marine particles is more prevalent when
cell and particle concentration is higher (e.g. algal blooms).

Do the math. That’s what the specialist said.
The first doctor winked. Some people just need
to get sick in order to relax. Thanks.
Your T cells go bat-crazy. They attack
the health host: it’s your immune system

running rampant through your lymph. It won’t stop.

Wikipedia: marine snow is a variety of mostly organic matter,
including dead or dying animals, and plankton ... also plant parts
and degrading plant material. Because of the relatively long
residence time of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation, carbon
transported as marine snow into the aphotic zone by the biological
pump can remain out of contact ... for more than a thousand years.A blue jay lands in the fringe tree. Sudden downfall of petals.
The massive galaxy of matter as the body floats down through
the ocean’s zones is granular, a snowy sand, agglomerate of
debris in slow orbit around the disintegrating husk of whale.
Here are the five most common “unnatural” causes of death.
Entanglement. Ship and propeller strikes. Commercial fishing
(i.e. human appetite). Bycatch. Climate change (i.e. global warming).

I was sick for years. Now it’s coming back.
Little serpent sipping there beyond the deck.A. colubrus. The need for names (my friend
wants to help) is thirst for clarity, affinity.
Yet sometimes I watch the trees. Let the whip
maples weep and go blur above the barn.
Now they’re a wash of green, a mere wave.
Now they carry me, as he says, in their arms.

When I pull out my old notes, my notebooks full of shaky words—
In the third stage, a whale fallen through the deepest oceanic zones—
