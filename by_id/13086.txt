
  A poet!—He hath put his heart to school,Nor dares to move unpropped upon the staffWhich art hath lodged within his hand—must laughBy precept only, and shed tears by rule.Thy Art be Nature; the live current quaff,And let the groveller sip his stagnant pool,In fear that else, when Critics grave and coolHave killed him, Scorn should write his epitaph.How does the Meadow-flower its bloom unfold?Because the lovely little flower is freeDown to its root, and, in that freedom, bold;And so the grandeur of the Forest-treeComes not by casting in a formal mould,But from its own divine vitality.
