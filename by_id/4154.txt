he verges his groove of slapstick smoke
across our donated mosquito nets bidi bidi bombom all night he fingertips our omnivorous junk
in his cruel maw of tooth gaps magical realistic
funky ass choral arrangements of servitude mighty
dump truck hip-ee hip-ee dales my rotunda all
over these unsullied shimmies bidi bidi bom bom
orb-spider thighs cloaking his genocidal hunches
Momma catapulting protection abracadabras
over our twiggy panoplies we painstakingly
bedecked how many times haven’t we fallen
for mishandled precipices in the wrongheaded
entirety of machomanic evacuation asteroid
in mouth-crooked chaps guayabera deep pink
guava pulp rum & coke in his fierce prayerful
grip to bypass civility a Google-translated wink
inumbrated eyebrows to cast embered mercies
I pump bidi bidi bom bom hormonal harmonies
for his jawlined mitzvahs bidi bidi bidi bidi bidi
on wings only light will kerfuffle flight born
at his bidding va-voomed for his favor we puff
from the tail of his pickup truck we clothes-
line an underwater continent marooned & whiplashed
for genesis if carnage can charade competency
we too can corrupt castanets timbre compulsory
penances over his padded knees bidi bidi bom bom
above his life insurance policy rates coma
with anointed vanity with the right song a stone
will pass for bread break for a fool’s sunrise achieve
the love ritual cut scorn’s willy bob hither to this bomb
