The favorite in the burial yardsI knew was common juniper.One could do worse than pass into such a species. I like to thinkthat when I’m gone the chemicalsand yes the spirit that was memight be searched out by subtle roots and raised with sap through capillaries into an upright, fragrant trunk,and aromatic twigs and bark,through needles bright as hoarfrost to the sunlight for a centuryor more, in wood repelling rotand standing tall with monumentsand statues there on the far hill,erect as truth, a testimony,in ground that’s dignified by loss,around a melancholy treethat’s pointing toward infinity.
