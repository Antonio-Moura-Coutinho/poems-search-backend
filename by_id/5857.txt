But what could live wanted to and tried,treading narrow circles, a glide of brittle ﬁns.He wore those rubber boots, though the sun wasan anvil, and very little wet; he smiled, I rememberthat, his nickel smile right at me, his ﬁngersletting fall the small ﬁsh muscles into a bag ﬁlledwith yellow tap. I didn’t ask his name, or whatit was he thought he was doing, but we talked,I listened as he taught me to relax the hand just enough.They can smell, he said, the oils our pores releasewhen we tense to catch. You have to believe it,he said. You don’t mean any harm.
