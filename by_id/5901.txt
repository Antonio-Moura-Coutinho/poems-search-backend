
Down, unequal weight on his haunchesand the rain driving his shirt sideways,his legs are as rigid as the stone and timberthat props him up. Ears, half-opened lipsslurred to bits; a head no longer ableto troubleshoot the broken glass inside him. • Wiry treetops are blacker. The after-rain lightdiffused to near neon-gray. There was a boyseen by neighbors running the width of the field.One said he disappeared — as if he fell headlonginto the horizon. Another said it wasn’t a boy,but a hart. Next to nothing left where Evanswas found, but there was a sound box,some thing in which his soul made itself felt.
