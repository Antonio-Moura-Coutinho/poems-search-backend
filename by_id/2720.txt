Ashes fell,coating crawling ivy and clover.A few yellowjackets fled,one or two swirled, flyinginto the sweaty face of my father,but most too stunned,their usual side-to-side swagof a dance, flailing in the smoke.When one landed on my arm, I stiffened.His wings settled into a still gauze,body coiled in yellow bands,the same shade as buttercups we heldto our skin, cupping sunlight near our chins.Every step, careful, quivering, as if neitherof us knew who was supposed to sting.
