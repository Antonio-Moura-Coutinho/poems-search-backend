A hundred times we do our own pedestrianversion of early maritime cartography: the known worldstops, and over its edge the fuddled mapmaker writesHere There Be Monsters and then illustrates their non-existing coiled lengths and hell-breathwith a color-splotched vivacity he wouldn’t wasteon inhabited shores. Or: “Don’t thinkof a polar bear!”...the game one playswith a child. But I say with adult certainty thatwhen Eddie’s wife Fiona went back to strippinghe couldn’t stand to be at the club and see, and yetthose empty hours in his mind were populated justas unbearably—and indeed, yes, therewere monsters in that void, and the vigilant bearsof insecurity and jealousy padded hungrily behindhis eyes each night until her return. For Keats,however, the force that emptiness makes kinetic isa positive one, the way that the invisible, unknowable“dark energy” is seminal, a kind of funding agencyor sugar daddy powering the universe in allits spangled beauty and veiled mysteryfrom behind the scenes. Last night, a woozy few of uswere mourning the demise of The Dusty Bookshelf.“Well I tried to support it,” I said, “by stopping in from timeto time.” And B, the king of local kleptobibliomania, withhis nimble touch and expando-capacious overalls, said“I tried to support it by not going in.”
