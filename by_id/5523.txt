
Brailed up from birth, these obdurate, obituary cornersof second life the hospital light ravened solsticeblessed with a caesarean and now we have a republic,the bread under arm, water-bearer of the sea: Cetus, Christ.After the blackbird I put on my herringbone jacket,the feather hummed gargoyles bearing down buildings,rain scowled down, Vallejo and Vallejo as I hurriedup Eager Street; Thursday, I remember the white stonein the flask and wild asterisks hissing; Thursdays, fallingat noon, at Cathedral Street, blackbirds falling quietly at Biddle Street.
