
I know better than to leave the housewithout my good dress, my good knife
like Excalibur between my stone breasts.Mother would have me whipped,
would have me kneeling on rice untilI shrilled so loud I rang the church
bells. Didnâ€™t I tell you that elegance is our revenge,that there are neither victims nor victors
but the bitch we envy in the end?
