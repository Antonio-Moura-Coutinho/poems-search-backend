If it became impossible to touch and be touched, to see
and be seen, to love and trade ecstasy for risk where risk
is ecstasy, to be hidden in plain view, to be perfectly lost
which means lost to the world, lying side-by-side arms linked
in a bond so intricate it could never unfold or break—
If it became crucial to live out of sight, to be housebound,
to walk a beaten path in the garden, to sit at the window
blurred by rainfall, to sit barred and blocked, books
set aside that would never be read, rolling news of flash flood
and fire, angels treading the updraft, a chaos of voices—
If dreams should give the rest of it: the path in the garden
going underground, flood and fire as God’s only gift
the house holding its secrets, that pattern of locked rooms,
