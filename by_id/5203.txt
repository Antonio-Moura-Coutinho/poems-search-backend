The dropped leaf coolsOn the uncut grass, supple still, still green,Twining still these fingers as they listless pullThe tangle straight until the tangle tightensAnd the hand is caught, another fallen leaf. The poetry of the earth never ceases Ceasing — one blade of grass denies beliefUntil its mere thread bears the grasshopper’sWhole weight, and the black cricket sings unseen,Desire living in a hole beneath the tangle’s green.
