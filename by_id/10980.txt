
Why do you shiver thereBetween the white river and the road?You are not cold,With the sun light dreaming about you;And yet you lift your pliant supplicating arms as thoughTo draw clouds from the sky to hide your slenderness.You are a young girlTrembling in the throes of ecstatic modesty,A white objective girlWhose clothing has been forcibly taken away from her.
