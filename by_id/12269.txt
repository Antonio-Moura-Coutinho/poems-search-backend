On the day the sienna-skinned man
held my shoulders between his spade-shaped hands,
easing me down into the azure water of Jordan,
I woke ninety-three million miles from myself,
Lev Davidovich Bronstein,
shoulder-deep in the Volga,
while the cheap dye of my black silk shirt darkened the water.
My head wet, water caught in my lashes.   
Am I blind?
I rub my eyes, then wade back to shore,   
undress and lie down,
until Stalin comes from his place beneath the birch tree.
He folds my clothes
and I button myself in my marmot coat,
and together we start the long walk back to Moscow.
He doesn’t ask, what did you see in the river?,
but I hear the hosts of a man drowning in water and holiness,   
the castrati voices I can’t recognize,
skating on knives, from trees, from air
on the thin ice of my last night in Russia.   
Leon Trotsky. Bread.
I want to scream, but silence holds my tongue   
with small spade-shaped hands
and only this comes, so quietly
Stalin has to press his ear to my mouth:   I have only myself. Put me on the train.   
I won’t look back.
