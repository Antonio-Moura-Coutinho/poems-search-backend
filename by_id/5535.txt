
After the murder, I called a meetingto see if we were happy. I declaredI was not — I said I liked the manwe shot. You all disagreed with this.I asked if you knew him, his wife,none of you did. “Kill me, then,”I said. You all stared at me. “Why,Bernard? Of course we won’t.”“Why not?” I said. “He was a goodman, a better man than me. Andlook at what I’ve brought you — rubbish, dodgy tales, dross.”“Easy to dismiss that,” you said.“We appreciated it all. And youwandered the wild paths to bringit back to us — your songs, yourlegends, magic stories, your gold.”I thanked you, but shook my head.The good man was dead. I didn’t carewhat I’d brought you. I needed to go.I packed up my sagas, my song lyrics,my alchemy potions, my gold, andI disappeared.
