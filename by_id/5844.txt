
Who needs a scary movie when there’s scary life.Icy days pile up like empty pill bottles.One craves hot soup and bear sex. I can’t hibernateabove the Kum & Go when there’s Smokey lightsall night. It isn’t easy making change for a twentyon a Tuesday night, when they’re filling the tanksbeneath the pumps and the manager’s on break.All underage kids must come here. And go here?The world rhymes with itself. Earth is earthand row is row, whether to pull a set of oars and scullor a line of cornstalks completing the farmer’s math.                          Up above the Kum & Go                          I’m reading Maya AngelouAnd there’s a head shop open 24 hrsthey do not sell head but you might think itthe way the patrons come and go all nightall fall all night all fall.I lived behind a sex club called The Power Exchange.All words have been charged with electric bodiesever since I wandered into my first poem.It was surely the Road Not Taken.Or maybe The Body Electric ... I’m easily mistaken.An alder is reptilian in its body, litheleaves at night and such vocal things.It is a sexy tongue the world speaks.So many licks to get to the polished moon.Tell me a story then. How did you come to betrampled or new or high where the warblers landand recklessly shit where they eat.The universe I fear to be crashing.No painkillers for Doug. Ugh.It’s just autumn come. Electrical storms.The brave fire of the leaves and everything.The pawpaw, along with the huckleberry,the chokecherry, cranberry, Concord grape, and persimmonis one of the indigenous fruits. I usually only get it here,and only this time of year. Fearis real. Especially that most unholy fearthat we will be forgotten. Fruit, when it’s rotten,opens a door to memory from other lives. Is it wrongto wish for another life? My hand can barelywrite the thought. My eye can barelysee, my soul, translate the fire into autumn’s sweet flush,persimmons taste like semen, pawpaw tastes like flesh,large hard seeds like date pits I spit off the balconyin summer into the parking lot belowwhere none are sure to be hit nor anything grow.A spider would not lower himself to touch suchconcrete ground. I would not live to see a treegrow to fruition, and yet each year I’d like to try.Well, Midwest, here I am. It’s pumpkin time.The cicadas have stopped singing.It’s just the crickets now along the river.But above the Kum & Go, it’s wind and machinery.Why do they all take the same path, and whydo these undergrads shout against the fall wind.The rebel angels’ cries are but the check-incries of birds, “hey Mike, hey Mike.” It mustbe hard to be Mike, your name reducedin the ears of others to a syllable of grief.And then it seems that Mike is gone. Relief.
