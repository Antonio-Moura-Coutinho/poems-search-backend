
O you gods, you long-limbed animals, youastride the sea and you unhammocked in the cyprus grove and you with your hairfull of horses, please. My thoughts have turned from the savor of plums to the merits of pity—touch and interrupt me, chasten me with waking, humble mefor wonder again. Seed god and husk god,god of the open palm, you know me, youknow my mettle. See, my wrists are small.O you, with glass-colored wind at your calland you, whose voice is soft as a turned page,whose voice unrolls paper, whose voice returnsair to its forms, send me a word for faiththat also means his thrum, his coax and surgeand her soft hollow, please—friend gods, lend mea word that means what I would ask him forso when he says: You give it all away,I can say: I am not sorry. I sing.
