You think it is brave to drinkvodka all morning on an empty stomach.The walls of our apartment flash. The walls of our apartment stand. They are bombing his hospital.He washes my face. He fingerspells the names of patients.The shadow of his fingers huge on the whitewashed wall.The walls of our apartment flash.When the bombs fallwe make children.He kneels and kissesthrough my skinthe shape of our only child.They are bombing his office.Takes his glasses off and lays them on the table like a shining weapon. Throws his t-shirt at our cat, fat hangs over his belt.Pulls a stolen lemonout his pocket.They are bombing his hospital office,But I am a ripe womana man could be happy.
