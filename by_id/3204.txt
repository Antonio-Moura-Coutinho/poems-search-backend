
My copy of The Fireside Book of Verseis as the seller promised—the stapled spine,the paper aged to Army tan—no worsefor wear, given the cost of its design,six cents to make and printed on a pressonce used for magazines and pulp. This bookwas never meant to last a war much lessthree quarters of a century.                                             I lookfor evidence of all the men who scannedthese lines, crouched down in holes or lying intheir racks. I read the poems secondhand.Someone has creased the page. Did he beginthen stop to sleep? to clean his gun perhaps?to listen to the bugler playing taps?
