No dice.We stack twigs for burningin glistening patchesbut the rain won’t give.So we wait, breedingmood, making musicof decline. We sit downin the smell of the pastand rise in a lightthat is already leaving.We ache in secret,memorizinga gloomy lineor two of German.When spring comeswe promise to actthe fool. Pour,rain! Sail, wind,with your cargo of zithers!November 1981
