
In an effort to get people to look
into each otherâ€™s eyes more,
and also to appease the mutes,
the government has decided
to allot each person exactly one hundred   
and sixty-seven words, per day.
When the phone rings, I put it to my ear   
without saying hello. In the restaurant   
I point at chicken noodle soup.
I am adjusting well to the new way.
Late at night, I call my long distance lover,   
proudly say I only used fifty-nine today.   
I saved the rest for you.
