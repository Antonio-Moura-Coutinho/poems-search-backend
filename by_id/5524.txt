I am going to go abovemy voice for the sake of the forest shakenon the bitumen. You can see stars in the skulls,winking, synapses, intermittent, on edgeof shriek — perhaps a cluster of fir, birches? — Anyways. Don’t get too hung upon the terms; they have entropyin common, bad for the public weal,those obtuse centurions in the flareof the bougainvillea, their patent-seekinggift kindled. Divers speech. Cruelty.Justice. Never mind, but dopay attention to the skirmish — the whitepanther that flitters up the pole — its shade grows large on the ground.
