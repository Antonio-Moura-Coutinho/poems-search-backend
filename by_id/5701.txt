1 In the high left light there’s a bombast figureof the iconoclast Harley — titledChairman of the Committee for theDemolition of Monuments of Superstitionand Idolatry — in operation mid 1600s.In forgiveness is lightly engraved in the grisaille glass near the base.His jig-on-coals is illumined to the foot:in the light below, skin-fierce shardsof thousanded glass are oblite against an anvil roadblack as a telly that’s off.2 Here the sanctity of the inextinct is vitrified.(There is in this, of course, the trick of the numinous,which apertures the mind then shuttersit with a captured click.)The second window is abstractedinto a green / yellow / redthat’s near tessellated at points,yet at its edges approaching random generationlike a screen saver projected. It is infernal.This color chart dispersal, that’s disordering orreordering.3 Then a spurt of leading leads out of the plaster tracery,these cames a cooled ore rootingLowhampton’s industry to a silica-limed wall — and the metal hid within a retraceof all the city’s greatnessthat’s gone before. Though nowis lost. There is at last the movingoff from the abstract; a tilting to the concrete:it seems, right here, that a hundredbuildings are storied in stone-thrown perspective.A city reinvented.4 In four: a clear-paned gemmailconnecting like-to-like, with no change of  tintor shape, no supporting leadlight.It’s as if it were a house window.Or something from an office block.It does not create or stain but gives an outsidefalling past Sainsbury’s and the Sander Towerlooming, then the ring road communionedtraffic forming. An open roompupiled towards rain in its rain-tone,the study of an unaltared sun.
