Its vessel curved concrete,but the same constant flow, gunneling south,hugging the contours of eastern Sierra,past Independence, the airport,the golf course, along the right hand of Owens’dry lake bed, red swirling dust clouds kept downby sprinklers. From up in the airthe twin Haiwee Reservoir is knuckleand knee joint where the line disappears — becomes pipeline and conduitunder the desert, punching for groundwater,surfacing riveted over Mojave,two hundred miles on from its native cradle,gray zombie spring tracing through forestto Santa Clarita, the treatment plant:the last reserve and loud cascadesabove the lights and life of Los Angeles.
