
Amidst the days of pleasant mirth,That throw their halo round our earth;Amidst the tender thoughts that riseTo call bright tears to happy eyes;Amidst the silken words that moveTo syllable the names we love;There glides no day of gentle blissMore soothing to the heart than this!No thoughts of fondness e'er appearMore fond, than those I write of here!No name can e'er on tablet shine,My father! more beloved than thine!'Tis sweet, adown the shady past,A lingering look of love to cast—Back th' enchanted world to call,That beamed around us first of all;And walk with Memory fondly o'erThe paths where Hope had been before—Sweet to receive the sylphic soundThat breathes in tenderness around,Repeating to the listening earThe names that made our childhood dear—For parted Joy, like Echo, kind,Will leave her dulcet voice behind,To tell, amidst the magic air,How oft she smiled and lingered there.
