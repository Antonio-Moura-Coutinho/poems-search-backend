In a courtyard, in these stacks of chairs
            before the empty stage—near arewe Lord, near and graspable. Lord,
            accept these humble offerings:
stacks of biscuits wrapped in cellophane,
            stacks of bone in glass: thighbone,
spine. Stacks of white saucers, porcelain
            circles into which stacks of lip-worn
cups slide neat. Jawbone, Lord. Galleries
            of laminated clippings declaring war.
Hands unstack chairs into rows. The dead:
            they still go begging.
