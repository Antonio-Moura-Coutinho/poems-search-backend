  i. a long voyage, 1621  I left you where you are:A humming late summer afternoon& mottled by shade a man reading a letterBecomes the image of a man readingThat I am forgetting.This page is small yet stout enough To bear me whole upon it to youAll the way in London. I may expand Myself at leisure then fold it tight,A sanctuary;Like our vessel christened The George,My letter is another ark to preserve me: George.No midnight is so private as the sea’s:Timbers breathe, a loose rope snaps, & as the windShoves you behind then slaps your face,Seeing nothing, nothing to be seen, you feelUnhoused, evicted from time.But tonight, my love, my lamp is feathered, shy, Herald of the next ransack & assail. Behold the storm petrel! gray wick-threaded throat Burning the oil secreted, an amber muskOf uncompassed seas & the solitary hunt, Of error & sign, &That delirium—which turnedOur ship’s boy to mowing fields of Atlantic salt.Like windrows he dropped the waves. Until gaffed, pulled like a sleeve Through himself, He will live, tongue-bit, torn.To return likely to a stool set on the shaleWhere he can mend nets skirted by braggartsWho have never traveled fartherThan the smoke dribbling from their chimneys.I try never to imagine drowning.Noisy urgent inefficiencies above, waves Pummeling, sky shredding, & the bodyAnchored only in its just longing for air.The tighter death’s embrace, the more languorousThe moment. So this boy sufferedSome vast charity of sight. He was what he saw, an adam. Now he may be adamant & stain & distance; & also that small satin interruptionOf terror—the instant breath’s Orphaned by self’s perishing through poetry. Like Daphne his voice is forfeit for the song,But we do not grieve for Daphne.My bird-light gutters. Its call had soundedLike dry wood giving up a nail.What is this your wound that you must follow it?For you I had no answer; consider only the reveriesOf the carpet navigator in his room. ListeningTo collisions of wave & star outside his tower,Rock-rapt, icebound, with a mind by dread & ceremony & the dozen arts of courtesy Girded, he invented those ideal earths in latitudesUnstrung that I now trespass—After I had translated two books To the pouring of seas & clamor of sailorsI began to brood long on landlessness, Coming to believe it my sovereign, my home, When on the flat horizon of weeks at noon the flaw:A color merely, private, ethereal, collectingHeft in the warp of time. Days Before we quailed at the barbed illegible peltOf forest, I wrecked, forlorn upon its savor,Sweet damage of apples Fermenting in rain-soaked hay,Giving way to something ranker—I tasted it at dinner lying on my tongue.I am His Majesty’s servant as my god made me;I am also my damps & exaltations; I am afraid.Heaven & hell enlisted their geographers, A map has opened the soul’s five hinges, & PersianWith expectance how often have I feasted On departure. London, Naples, Marriage, Damascus, now your dear person.So much flowing through meMy sight has silted dark my mouth. I begAll the many tongues your wonder cabinet holds—Dolphin, mockingbird, Muscovy bear—to tellThis arrival, so unforeseen, disorderly As my hope you will not forget who I was, & am,Unwildered, unwestered, constant, returning.Bless you where you are, & where you would beWhen you are there, & bring you thither.                                          My love,What may never not be strange? What,This morning, will wake & make me new. ii. winter 1621  It begins like a legend told to a fretful child:It was, it was, and it was not. It beginsAs if with symptoms of that sweatI hear, so late (oh notThank God too late), you were spared:A little blush along the throat. A restlessness.Then the silkworm’s casement, tapering & pale as the egg of a chimney-swift,Which we will convert to cloth To cover the naked Indian. A bobbin,Which dropped in my tisane would ravel the maelstromOf silk. Spindle of whirlwind, spoonfulOf follow. The thread’s stained scalding mile Pours out my glass tempered in our kiln,As each new settler is also seasonedIn this furnace, our new-found land.(As the man drowning believes he digestsThe mild water, as the damned marry flame& yet blister, so do I know myselfGrasped by change at the stroke of change.)Hold this glass up to your eye & throughIts pebbled horizon you may spy your room,See its ire of surfaces sore with chairs. Green grass green grace...Would that I could account this world oneWhere nothing is lost only exchanged.Without coppice, park, romancely glade, Or commanding vantage, Woods press on us; they fester, & they watch. To the northeast white spruce,Phalanxes of fledging pinions, clamp Root to granite & hoardWhat they glean off salt-fog, sea-spray, & stone. From ewers of willow-oaks darkness steams.At breakfast I have pinched the plantlets Insinuated by a maple’s winged seed overnight;It unclasps twin leaves, pale hands Loosening the soil of my rest,They never empty of their solicitations.I find no empires here, no apostles or emeralds.Instead, all things a-broil with an awful begetting& my hours unsettled by some new showOf riotous & mystical imagination.Though we might wish to wedge us barnacle-tightTo shore’s edge, our foundation raisedOn marshland recalls this irritable fact—The estuary, a nursery of strange devices, Throws off new forms so promiscuouslyI wonder how the world holds any more shapeThan a dream?From my hand at night (my lightA little oil in a dish or a rush taper smokingNot so different from his), flower Ovid’s fantastic shapes, shadows Of an old empire’s former splendorNow perjured by Virginia’s clay & leaf & sand Turned to the king’s profit as iron, silk, & glass.Belief is possible at night, solitary, firelit.Then, I can believe in Ovid’s centaurs,Or at death that he was met by a three-headed dog.I can believe in your letters, which never come.It is for you that I persistIn translating fresh birdsong, like this bunting’sComecomecome wherewherewhere All together      down the hill. (Where did they go, who went before us?Starved trove: scatter of blue beads & a nameGrafted to that bald acre. Roanoke.There is my terror & my tale: to go west Under this eternity of nameless trees.)And what will you make of this Humble hieroglyphic of nature I forward to you?Nocturnal, double-wombed, variously calledMonkey Fox; Frosted,Or Short-headed, or Indolent.Let this Leafy-Eared Rat-Tailed ShufflerThe naturals call Possoun Join your zoo’s other fantasies & with the Little Military Learnéd Horse Enjoy its dish of ale. Its fur is durable;Its flesh wholesome, white, & pleasant.With one hand I can reach forA medicine man’s last breath caught in a vialOr a hummingbird, stuffed With arsenic & leaves & looking Like a fine jeweled dagger aimed at my heart, With the other hand I brush away The web spun in a fox skull’s whitened socket While a wild turkey glowers from its cornerLike a small dyspeptic dragon.My cullings do not quite master my closet.When I imagine myself returned to the smells& noise of London, from my stiff kneeSands grinding as I walk, no marvelsExcept those which the mirror surprises in all of us,The swan-white wing at my temple, I do not know what to hope for:That you do not see me, or that you do,But as though I were pinned under glass.At my windowsill a quince widensA jaundiced eye into the dark where areReal nettles beneath the words & invincible redRoot of the madder. As long as any image of this worldSticks in my soul, I remain— iii. spring1622
