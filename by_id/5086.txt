That veiny Chineselantern, its stolid jellyof a fruit, not only has no aroma but is twice as tediousas the wild strawberry’s sunburststem-end appendage: each one mustbe between-nail-snipped at both extremities.Altogether, gooseberry virtuestake some gettingused to, as does trepang,tripe à la mode de Caen,or having turned thirteen.The acerbity of all things greenand adolescent lingers in it—the arrogant, shrinking,prickling-in-every-direction thorn-iness that loves no company except its,or anyhow that’s what it gets:bristling up through gooseberry ghetto sprawlare braced thistles’ silvery, militantly symmetricaldefense machineries. Likewise inseparably en-tangled in the disarray of anuncultivated childhood, where gooseberry bushes (sincerooted out) once flourished, isthe squandered volupté of lemon-yellow-petaled roses’ luscious flimflam—an inkling of the mingling into one experienceof suave and sharp, whose supremely im-probable and far-fetched culinaryembodiment is a gooseberry fool.Tomorrow, having stumbled intothis trove of chief ingredients(the other being very thickest cream)I’ll demonstrate it for you. Ever since,four summers ago, I first brought you,a gleeful Ariel, the trophyof a small sour handful,I’ve wondered what not quite articulated thingcould render magical the green globe of an unripe berry.I think now it was simplythe great globe itself’s too much to carry.December 1981
