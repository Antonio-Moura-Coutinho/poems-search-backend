Lovell, 19from Oneonta, New York Statewho appears in the police blotterin Thursday’s Daily Star forunlawful possession of marijuana.The police blotter hangs justbelow the cast of Hairpsrayrehearsing at the suny oneontagoodrich theaterwhere the girl playing TracyTurnblad looks as if she’s beenhelping herself to donuts:maybe the donuts we were eatingat Barlow’s General Store, Treadwell.Do you ever get an upstate rush?I’ve never been crazy about donutsbut these are the aristocratsof the donut world and I salute them.And I hope, Benjamin, your momisn’t going to be too mad as she castsher eye down the police blotterand sees your name there, You little shit!and I hope the authorities rememberbeing young when the whole worldsometimes seemed somehow likea gargantuan donut that either pulledyou to its bosom (O Tracy!) or kickeddown — somewhere — to the bloodstream.Sweet donut, do I love thee? I haven’tmentioned Brando K. Goodluck, 18,from Manhattan, charged with seventh-degreecriminal possession of a controlledsubstance. O Brando, O Brandowhat were you thinking?As I put a donut in my mouthI’m thinking I wouldn’t minda joint, and, in any case, maybeall these donuts are pretty dangerousand I wonder what would happenif the rules got jumbled upand the girl playing Tracy Turnbladslid down the pageand found herself in the police blottercharged with unlawful possessionof a donut. Suddenly America feelsdifferent and I like it.Police blotters throughout the nationpacked with donutheads and half the countryon the run as college girls makesecret calls and meet their dealersin dusty ghost towns, sweetvapors drifting through the trees.O America, where even the robinsare bigger, where every car thatslides into the forecourt of Barlow’sGeneral Store is a Dodge, wherehalf the population is chasingthe perfect donut. Let’s imaginethat Benjamin P. Lovell andBrando K. Goodluck, nice slim boys,who never touched a donutin their lives, wander into Barlow’sand roll a joint and talk about thoselosers who kneel down before “the big one.”They know the girl who was playingTracy Turnblad. She was sweet, they say,who went and threw it all awayfor a sleazy bun with a hole in it.They pass the joint to me and I canfeel the donuts I stuffed in hastesomewhere down my slacks. I blush.Real shame, I say. Mrs. Barlow saysYou boys want more coffee?The donuts on her shelves have gone.
