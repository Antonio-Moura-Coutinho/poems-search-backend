Three scars began to scab on her arm,deep big-cat scrawls she told us she cut herselfbecause it’s art and her clients like herthat way. We followed her clip-clop downthe rabbit hole; me, to hear tales of her running trackin those shoes; you, to see her white skin even palerunder lights. Back in your dorm room, I am static.You pay to watch her pixelated Snow White online;complain her constant chatter ruined it, or her, for you.
