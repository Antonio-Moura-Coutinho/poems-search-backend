
When I was twelve, I wanted a macaw
 but they cost hundreds of dollars. If we win the lottery? I asked.

Macaws weren’t known to be great talkers, 
but they were affectionate.
 Yes, my mother said. If we win the lottery.  
I was satisfied, so long as it wasn’t impossible.
The macaw would be blue.
