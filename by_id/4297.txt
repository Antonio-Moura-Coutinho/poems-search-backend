The ovaries, when splayed, resemblesliced tomatoes. Or rose windows,
each geometry precise enoughto praise. I want to press my tongue
against the bloodroot petal, to runits stamen along my slick shelf of
teeth like a man might with a wheat stalk.Four times so far other tourists
have taken me for a galleryattendant. In the glass, a slow-
sidling crimson spreads over my ownskewed reflection: a hesitant
teen in a Harvard hoodie, the fifth,leans in to ask, Excuse me, sir?Are they really glass? — a testamentto how my binder encases
my breasts, my faith in the plum yew’s fruit-shorn frenzy. Dense clusters teeming
with their separate blossoms, anyunknowing eye might think they were
living. But I know the lilac’s tell:two blemishes, bulbous where some
hot glass mis-dripped, then caught foreverin the filament. Sometimes, I think
I’ll wake to find they’ve finallytrickled off me in the night, pooled
molten down the bed and gatheredback again. I might thrash off both breasts
in a sleepless fit, or could unfurlmy clit like a pollen basket passed
from a honeybee’s hind legsto the hive. It makes its secret
seen. I can only answer yes. Yes,They’re real. I mean, they’re really glass.
You could snap a stem between fingerswith such a slight force, one stark blink — 
the flies flitting the gallery would fearthe weight of their own landing,
thick wings rapt still. When the public,in their distressed astonishment,
demanded to know how the Blaschkastransported the models without
a fracture in even one pistil,Leopold Blaschka revealed his own
elaborate process: pack eachflower tightly in its cardboard
cradle, then strap them down with strong wireto restrict movement, and set each, at last,
in a wooden box wrapped with burlap.They drove them straight from Manhattan
in two hearses. The drivers, of course,wore black suits. Onlookers parted
to allow their small procession past.I like it here, with everyone
focused on the flowers. Hunched, kneeling,as if suspicious, still doubting,
the teen eyes two tiny zinnias,then moves on to another case.
I’ve seen many leave unsatisfied.They can’t bear to be partitioned — 
how can I blame them? Someone made thesewith their body. They let their breath
unspool to form each impossiblebud, crafted every flower’s fold,
then waited on the heat to break tohold just one, wearing special gloves.
Wouldn’t anyone wish for just one lieamong a garden this precise?
One daisy swapped out in secret, switchedwith a common courtyard flower,
now waiting for someone to noticeits wilt while its counterparts keep
all their glisten. It does seem to metrue punishment: never to change.
Unflinching forever. Sometimes, nearclosing, when the hall becomes quiet,
I really do believe they’re real.
