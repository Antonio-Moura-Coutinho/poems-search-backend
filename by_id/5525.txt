
A furnace in my father’s voice; I prayed for the coal stove’sroses, a cruise ship lit like a castleon fire in the harbor we never walked,father and son, father drifting downthe ferned hell his shanty shone, where,inside, in my head, the lamp was the lamp.The market, the park, the library not a soulbut grandmother’s morning wash lifting toward heaven,the barrister sun punished my sister, I stared at my handin a book, the horizon declined in my mouth.My little earthshaker, visored in placenta,wonder of wonders, tremulous in amnioticshield, ensouled already, father in the veritablenight, without house or harbor, soon sea in a voice will harrowa scorpion’s blaze in me, to the marrow.
