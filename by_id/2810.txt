one bird from another, a shrubfrom a weedy sapling, 
or when the season hadforced a flower’s bloom, not 
even if a berry
had ripened into poison.
And yet they drew endless
distinctions between
colors and polish andcoarseness of weave, 
and would not lettheir daughters marry out.They didn’t keeptheir children, though theygave them tests and fed them. They were knownfor meticulous records, for trophies and peeling stars.They burned things upor wore them down, had ranksand staff and lecterns, machines that moved themfrom place to place, bright jewels and playing cards.They were old when they could have been young, and youngwhen they could have been old. They left a strange wordin a tree: croatoan,and a track in the dust of Mars.
