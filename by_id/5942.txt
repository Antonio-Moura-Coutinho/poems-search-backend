After joy raises you into the stratosphere,ride earthâ€™s colors as you wheel down.Fear backs you into a cave,only then do you cackle and hiss.Curse at a tornado and it might curse back.Why kick pebbles on your enemy?You will die without burying him.The ascent out of despairmust be steady, slow, or your lungswill explode, your blood boil.Which is wisest: to endure hungeror waddle among wolves?Warn those you love when the predatorapproaches. Screech loudest when youare the predator.
