Where we Away our Steel, “flood”    means “flow.” Where we Tenure our Ammo, “podium”    means “drum.” Flood,flow.Podium,drum.Flood,drum.Podium,flow.Drum,podium.Flood,flow.  Used to be a whole lot of chalk around the Ark,then anger, then angels, their wings made of fried white dust,fallen from when the board of knowledge was public and namedafter a stranger or rich crook, an anti-in immigrant-can’tameterstretched across the teepee-skin, chairs of classwhere we clapped     the erasers, fifty snows old,     like we were     the first Abraham, where we clapped     the Race Erasers     and drove away     from K  James V and K Leo PB     in shiny Lincolns,     sprinkling holy sheeple from the sky,     their     powdery     absolute Rule.

Whatchamacall “how we here,” and get no response ... howwe ... where we fear, how we hear how we sound and how sometimestime is some even our own sound fears us, and remembers the first us, confronting Columbus with thunderbolts,  when “was-we” not good-citizen sober, “was-we”voting and drowning,  and rotting like “we-was” the armed guts of our young?Now a daze, tribe-be-known, the devil the best historian we got. Anyhow.
