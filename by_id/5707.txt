Raw colorsreturning with the first days of spring unkempt and ravenousto the faculty, students linking arms with practiced easein giro through a stream of bicycles trilling in sweet voices.Kisses desired in full view returned, the elegant cafesaudible from the river where the sky wanders through its city.Austen and Gaskell. Coffee, a stroll. Austen again. Brontë.I met her. The gray, lavish eyes. A ruthless stare softenedby an accent. She was gracious, even to my callow posturing — called one windy effort that ended O Lord thou draggest me outa most faithful homage to Eliot, grave with kindly mockery.I drank my bitter tea. But consider this: her calves in sheer silkstill a girl’s, her polished tan half-heels set against them:magnificent. That Italian air, the strict bob ordering her face.And driving back with Pinkie at his schoolmasterly pace,I picked my nails and watched myself in the dark wing when“The King in Thule” suddenly swelled with falling cadencethrough the speakers, its pure aurality heraldingthe shattering white late snow of April, the road a veinof black ore exhausting itself slowly to the north,the fields at Rogationtide émpty, innocent of all things, even life.     i                   ii                                                     iii fay pomerance Beneath the shadow of hís wings, the scales stand baited against us.Maddox, charming predator, robustly mustachioed, vividbehind thick lenses condemning that discredited iconography —towers collapsing through quicksand, pavanes of anguish,the bodies of the lost ransacked by hobgoblins —reclines, his hatred virtue, its vital purity and strength,all his outrage told against those humiliating genuflections.Since there is no model for her features, conceive of herblanched as the Cabbage White, each brushstroke the dramaof a tiny kenosis, the bright clatter of ferrules over-heard as conversation at a distant table, queasy and isolating —Babel. Tower of teacups at ominous angles in the studio,rings indelibly stamped in the watercolor paper’s grain.Stretched in membranes of fat: passover, Lamb. Burning leaven.Head ringing with psilocybin and gin, I kneel in the foregroundof my own life quarter-sized, self-consciously humbled,like the donor in Altdorfer’s Crucifixion peering throughthe shadow of the cross to the city emptied of day laborersthat rides at ease in the sun, bay deliciously windswept,the curdled blue of high summer fadingout beyond the spruce where she stands in her living robes —and still I cannot comprehend how incidental we areto our own redemption, though the sacrifice remains intimatein violence, the half-accepting flinch of the faceas if breasting the parapet or tensed into the impactof a tube train, the rapt mother in the privacy of her distress.Here is the gate of horn, the hacked boughof ash that even dying shivers forth gaily its barrowloads of leaves.jack clemo Let there be a chamber wherein no other light comes Not that I forget, but that, increasingly, the objects of my memorybecome ripe for disparagement: irrational or petit bourgeois,complicit in imperial power, conjurors of airslapped down by wolfish lecturers with gestures of ennui,pared nails and implacable smiles, vicious with piety.Little traitor, I defend them with a wounded stare and no more —perhaps, I find my place among them, being so cold and all.Bone-white pits of china clay gouged throughthat vision, the extravagant gaze of grace balanced upon us,its soteriology divorced from nature — something terrifyingin declaration, his unforgiving line like being hunted.From the steeply-banked clay tips new dumps of refuse clatterto extend the protectorate of sand, sparse pricklesof mica like fields in snow — above all, the dogma never thaws.And nothing. The day we climbed slowly out of Antequerathrough the cloud base stippled in dew, the lightly slung bluebells of nazarenes blazed between karst and darkness,wild rose and orchid, the unaccountable blood of the peonyaching toward a sound that was both forsakenness and longing —wolves baying somewhere deep in the park —and I turned to you and wanted to know what next?Lost, we turned and turned and turned about among the stacks.Wings drilling the invisible host from cover to coveralerted us, the cramped and sullen thorns in anguish loomed.Until, picking our way down a gully deepening into spate,the fog whitened, glared alarmingly, then lifted in one sweepfrom the sheer drop-off of the cliff — we sawas if through glass the road receding among gray rocks | the citadel.
