The leoparddazzling in his camouflage, breakingthe urgent glass. In the underlayerof  humus and moss and broken claythe cryptogams, the earthworms turningbetween the wizardly fingersof the forest, managed growthof the second order, the third, steeredtoward what shoal, a historyfor the benefit of imaginary extrinsic persons.In the branches snowy owlsand ravens, or the rock pigeons we callpigeons, that can’t perch in trees, that swarm citieslike the flying rats they are, hungry,iridescent at the neck like therats themselves shining like a collarat the base of a public sculpturemonument to the fundamental flightthrough corridors of power, mathematics,heat death rippling like an invisible wavedown State Street, paralleling Michigan,pushed by the restless concinnationsof  the El, cutting longitudes across the lake itself,desert of watermeeting the migrations of alien carp andcosmic rays, diving deep for the wreckof the Edmund Fitzgeraldor swimming invisible lines, boundariespoliced by radar, from Canadaa mass of air launched by minute variationsin temperature, push and pull over heatislands, carbon dioxide absorption,ozone exhaustion invisible and interveninglike a god: that which manifeststhrough its action on substance, not itselfsubstance: weak forces, atmospheres,unnamed unmet animal speciesgone extinct, whole genuses, phyla,unknowable kingdoms and principalities,coral reefs burned black likethe crouched and burdened angels,muscular sketches of our vacancyas in an etching by Blake, horizontal,the spiritual body dividing like a hyphen the upper from the lower,phatic messenger of  betweenness,inhuman round eyes fixed on nothing, on suffering,folly, sporting events, on Gaza — wings outstretched to bandage the eyes of  Heaven,our eyesas they would bandage the wound of a headless child or conceal the strength of a peoplefrom their weakness, the mortalsmasquerading as their own fates, individualsslashed open by solitude, acts of mourningand revenge, writing themselvesinto the text of righteousness. The messengersreveal nothing, like the animalsmarching slowly toward me now, two by two,tongues lolling, eyes lit from within hollow and sparklingas a cave concealed from light for thirty thousand yearsbut concealed no longer. Grace have I nonebut what can be inferredby arms opening, palms, head tilting backto catch rain in my jaws:what is born, now, what wrests its wayout of the eternal feminine, the bodymy only warrant, against monuments my pledgeto the immaculate moment. What is bornis not of me, or the we, or of god, or animals.It is a wing. It is bleeding.It masks my eyes until the thunder comesto open the openness over all.
