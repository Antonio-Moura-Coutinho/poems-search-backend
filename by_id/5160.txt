My skiff is made of spicewood       my oars are Cassia bractMusic flows      from bow to starboard Early Mozart     cool side of  Coltrane   and miles and miles     of   Miles Cheap Californian Merlot       and my young boyfriend • If   I could master      the nine doors of my bodyAnd close my heart       to the cries of   sufferingPerhaps     I could love you like no otherFloat my mind      toward the other side of   hate• The shanty towns of   Tijuana       sing for youThe slums of   Little Sudan       hold evening prayerOne dead brown boy is a tragedy     Ten thousand is a statistic So let’s fuck    my love       until the dogs pass• All beautiful boyfriends are transitoryThey have no souls     they’re shiny brown fleshTomorrow they’ll turn into      purple festering corpsesFissured     gored    by a myriad flies• Down the Irrawaddy River       you lay yourself   to sleepNo sun no moon          no coming no goingNo causality   no personalityNo hunger     no thirst• Malarial deltas      typhoidal caysTsunamis don’t judge     Calamity grieves no oneThe poor will be submerged     the rich won’t be savedPurge the innocent     sink the depraved• What do I smell        but the perfume of   transienceCrushed calyxes         rotting phloemsLet’s write     pretty poems        pretty poems      pretty poemsMasque stale pogroms    with a sweet whiff of oblivion
