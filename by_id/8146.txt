
OUR PATRON OF FALLING SHORT,
WHO BECAME A PRAYERI used to sneak into the movies without paying.   
I watched the stories but I failed to see the dark.
I went to college and drank everything they gave me,   
and I never paid for any of that water
on which I drifted as if by grace until
after the drownings, when in the diamond light
of seven-something A.M., as the spring was tearing   
me up in Cartajena, only praying
on my knees before the magnifying ark
of the Seventh St. Hotel could possibly save me,   
until falling on my face before the daughter   
of money while the world poured from the till
brought the moment’s length against the moment’s height,   
and paying was what I was earning and eating and wearing.
