
A man celebrates erstwhile conquests,
his book locked in a silo, still in print.
 
I scribble, make Sharpie lines, deface
its text like it defaces me. Outside, grain
 
fields whisper. Marble lions are silent
yet silver-tongued, with excellent teeth.
 
In this life I have worshipped so many lies.
Then I workshop them, make them better.
 
An East India Company, an opium trade,
a war, a treaty, a concession, an occupation,
 
a man parting the veil covering a woman’s
face, his nails prying her lips open. I love
 
the fragility of a porcelain bowl. How easy
it is, to shatter chinoiserie, like the Han
 
dynasty urn Ai Weiwei dropped in 1995.
If only recovering the silenced history
 
is as simple as smashing its container: book,
bowl, celadon spoon. Such objects cross
 
borders the way our bodies never could.
Instead, we’re left with history, its blonde
 
dust. That bowl is unbreakable. All its ghosts
still shudder through us like small breaths.
 
The tome of hegemony lives on, circulates
in our libraries, in our bloodstreams. One day,
 
a girl like me may come across it on a shelf,
pick it up, read about all the ways her body
 
is a thing. And I won’t be there to protect
her, to cross the text out and say: go ahead—rewrite this.
