I gleam of sickness.You give me morning, Lord, as yougive earthquake to all architecture.I can forget.                           You put that sugarin the melon’s breath, and it is wetwith what you are. (I, too, ferment.)You rub the hum and simple warmthof summer from afar into the hipsof insects and of everything.I can forget.                           And like the sea,one more machine without a memory,I don’t believe that you made me.                          PRIME
