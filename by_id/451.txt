
at the unemployment office
I know it can be a two hour deathly wait
before one’s name is called out
so I find a chair and bury my head
in a book that I brought to read
 
sitting beside me, a man and a woman converse
talk of years past, of people they knew
 
       and Leonard, is he still in prison? 
       yeah, he’s still doing time      well, that’s good, I guess, means he’s still alive
 
a young girl walks in, short black halter top
and airbrushed-on jeans
her breasts pouting up past a too-low neckline
the men, the women, all stare
whether they’d like to or not
 
Leonard’s friends exchange stories
       yeah, my ex, she just wants my money      I tell her, well, go work then! 
 
and they laugh between the ironylife, huh, she tells him, it’s crazy, the things we get into, 
he agrees
the rest of us caught silently in their exchange agree, as well
 
his arms are thick with hair
and tattoos of skills
and scrawled out
indecipherable letters of the alphabet
 
      yeah, this chick that was riding with me once, he tells her
    got her jacket belt caught on my wheel   I didn’t even know it until I got to the next light
   I went back, she was alright, just fell off, didn’t get hurt or nothing  she was pissed though. 
 
“just fell off, didn’t get hurt,” what does he mean?
this story just drops off, I want to know a little more, a lot more
I mean, how fast was the bike going when she fell off
did she ruin the belt, scrape her nose
did they drink a lot of beer afterwards?
 
and so the time drags by, the line lengthens
now and then people unbury their heads
from their midmorning dragging into noon thoughts
women adjust their bra straps
scold their kids with unfulfilled warnings
the folks behind the counter look at us
holding their half empty cups of coffee
 
ah, if only there was a dollar for every story
