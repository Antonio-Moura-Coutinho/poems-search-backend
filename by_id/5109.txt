
Out of cash, out of well-fitting trousers,Out of soap and apples,Out of pencils, out of my keeper’sReach. I wish to set myself afireBut may not. This morning(Last night) in the common room I watched the administrationOf oxygen to one who had noneAnd I would not sit down, demandingTo do so.Later I happened on a manAt the piano, and though I have happened five or six times On men at the piano,None moved his hand like thisWithin the keys.I sat beside him, looking for a soundA chest sound. Not listening; I don’t listenAnymore. I make musicBut I don’t listen.
