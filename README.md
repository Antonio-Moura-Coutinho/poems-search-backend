# Emotion-Powered Poem Search Engine



The search for literary works, particularly poems, based on emotional content is a complex task. Traditional keyword-based search engines often fail to capture the nuanced emotional undertones of poems. This project aims to develop a search engine that categorizes and retrieves poems based on specific emotions, enhancing the discoverability of poetry that resonates with the reader's mood or interest.

Existing keyword-based search engines typically rely on the literal words in the text, which can overlook the deeper emotional resonance of poems. By contrast, our approach leverages advanced NLP techniques to better align search results with the emotional content users are seeking.
The system integrates natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) techniques to classify and index poems by their emotional vectors
