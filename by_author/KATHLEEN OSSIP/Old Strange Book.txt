In the story of my life there is a book.The book was bound in rough green cloth.Its glossy pages smelled oddly like puke. The book told the story of two children,Johnnie and Jill, I think.They got lost in a deep forest,drawn in thick dark ink. They were brother-and-sister orphans.They met fantastical creatures.One was the goddess of spring, or was that in Botticelli’s picturethat I saw in the same libraryin a book of art history for kids,old European art of course. The other kinds they did not want us to know about.The picture was magicand so was Johnnie and Jillthough not a children’s classic.I don’t really remember the title.In the book the goddess of springrescues the children in troubleand then — I can’t remember a thing.I’m sure there was a villainin the book, probably a woman, who practiced dark arts on a dark hill,so evil she wasn’t human. In the story of my life there is a hillthat tamely rises above the field.We sledded there in winter.In spring our bikes wheeleddown the hill dangerously.I walked on the hill this summertamely, carefully, slowly,alongside my mother.It isn’t hard to saywhat had brought us there. We were old and middle-agedin the knife-like summer air.Slowly and tamely we walkedand I remembered the book.It was called — Julie and John?I wanted another look.So what was the title?And was it an allegory?A Catholic one? (It was a Catholic school.)That would ruin the story.A story is only good if it’s made upbut convinces you it’s true.Even better if one of the charactersis someone who could be you.How else do you know who you are?I once asked an old strange friend:You only know you’re the person who’s withthe people you love, in the end.
