Whose hands touched, first, the headof the penis, the shaft?And was it soft                          or shale?  More rockthan clay.And who pinched firstinto their place the small cups at the base of the ass?                                         Who was itgot down there, on whose knees,and blew—                         and was that passionor panic, the machine that drovethose exhalations?                                        —and howcould we rate the power of thatbreath—breeze or gale or a whisperlike the song the little boy singsto the beetle,                          whose small legs moved in tune like his legs, the legs on that first body, must havemoved, if they did move, when                                                        the dust settled.In my mind everything’s become enormous.But was it ever small like that, the first body?Did it ever sit close to the ants and their pilesof dirt from which that body had come?You were a small boy once, I suppose.You were dirty from the start.  You showed me how to use a cock ring,and why.                          How, without ever paying for a room, to spend two weeks in any city.How two men could fuck and continue to face each otherdirectly             —took my body and showed me,my back on a table, my knees by my head.  Stretched me                          into seeing you were more than a dog.You must be dead by now, though I don’t knowwhose hands prepared you.                                                       Whose fingersfingered, for the final time,all that dark and kinky hair?If the first body was made of dirt,in order to plumb the hollow of that first throat, whose thumb first lodged inside the hingeof that first mouth to force it open?To make the tongue, so it could work,who shoved inside that mouththe shit of a hundred thousand worms?
