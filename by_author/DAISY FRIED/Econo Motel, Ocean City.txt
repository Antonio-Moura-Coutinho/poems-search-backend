Grease-dusted ceiling fan paddles erratically, two spars missing. Sheets whirled to the polluted rug. I reach under the bed, fish out somebody else’s crunched beer can, my forearm comes out dirty. Monster brachiates from bridge girders like a gibbonlooping round and around uneven bars, those are your fingersin my tangles or my fingers, my head hangshalf off the king-size, monster takes tiny child actorto its bone stash. Pillow’s wet. The warped ceiling mirror makes us look like fat porno dwarfsin centripetal silver nitrate ripples. My glasses on the side table tipped onto scratchproof lenses, earpieces sticking up like arms out of disaster rubble. Your feet hooked over my feet. What miasmalays gold dander down on forms of temporarysurvivors wandering the promenade?
