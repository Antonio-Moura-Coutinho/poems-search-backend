
That marsh hawk,its blown-leaf flight across Tomales Bay fog, summer’s abraded light,the Pacific tide pressuringand squeezing wave on wave into the bay’s pinched inlet. . .We feel somehow between usstill water crushed by that sea,so constant it seems not to be.The hawk, a circus, tumbles,stops, stands upon the air,beats its wings as if to shoo the sun’s drenched veils, and its clapping wings stopour unstoppable argument,that love goes, who knows why,and delivers us from pain to pain, air with teeth that seems to eat more air.  Northern harrier, owl face, they sea-changed your name,who listens with your faceand shows not love but want, speed, life in flight toward, forever toward,pausing at every chanceto use what ocean-bornbayside air sustains youby resisting you. We thankyour sunken head bonesand wild close-to-water seekingthat somehow speaks to us,           delivers us                     to another amazed                               agonized place.
