They mentionedthe vinyl recliner in the kitchen,the “I Like Ike” poster, the Sacred Heart,cabbage smells, sulfur, and shame.Before jolted by the gift that calledthrough but never really for her,she became unpleasantly calm.Moments later, after she said“I don’t want this please,” God’s loveraced down the pulse into her look.It was as if her things spoke back:a table leg scraped the floor, a forkwobbled in a drawer, knickknacks fell.She nearly died each time it happened.They said her mind just wasn’t there,or she wasn’t in it anymore.She sat helpless afterward,papery when they lifted herfrom vision seat to bed. The mightto move what her eye fell uponis the image of her I keep,her iridescent readiness.
