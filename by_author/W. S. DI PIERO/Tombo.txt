He smiled, our brother, at the story he told of   deliverance at the hand of   Master Tombo,            lord and creator, whose round energylives in us surrounds us surrounds our milk           our butter our eggs: see Him there,in the Slurpee glaze upon the freezer case?           In that elder by the yogurt shelves?I believed his happiness and coveted            a tidy universe. He picked his feetwhile a child whimpered by the melons, her nanny’s           mango aura made the cold blown airtouch my brain, I smelled myself in my aging body            and felt my silly bones collapse again.I wanted Tombo’s dispensation to save           this faint believer and the indifferent worldthat rivers through and past me. Down my aisle            lavender respired from the flower stalland Security spoke kind words to our prophet.          Oh I love and hate the fickle messy washof speech and flowers and winds and the tides           and crave plain rotund storiesto justify our continuity. To the Maya corn was god,           spilled blood made corn grow,the blood gods shed watered needy ground           and became People who worshipped the corn.Tombo’s grace carries us, convinced, from one            inarticulate incoherent moment to the next.Tonight the wet streets and their limelight sigh.          Orion turns, burning, unchanged again.Bread rises somewhere and its ovens scent the trees.           My poor belief   lives in the only and allof   the slur of   what these are, and what these are           streams toward loss in moments we live through.As children we were lost in our opaque acts            but fresh and full in time. I rememberhow I touched a girlish knee, how one boy           broke another’s face, how we all stoodin hard gray summer rain so it would run          down the tips of noses to our tongues.
