Oh.And the sad rhetoric spreadsthrough suburb and wood.Those who hear dove moan love no querulous warbling more—the going hence about which is there no- thing to do? From no small rip in fatethe you you never shall bemore will be extracted.Dove knows the rubricand starts in, who, who is next and soon?
