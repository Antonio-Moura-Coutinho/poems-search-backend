Its death protects a collection of tinier deaths and other dirts beneath.Although the white paint is water-stained, on it death is dirt, and hapless.The just-severed tiger lily is drinking its glass of water, I hope.This hope is sere.This hope is severe.What you ruin ruins you, tooand so you hope for favor.I mean I do.The underside of a ladybug wanders the window. I wanderthe continent, my undercarriage not as evident,so go more perilously, it seems to me.But I am only me; to you it seems clearI mean to disappear, and am meanand project on you some ancient fear.If I were a bug, I hope I wouldnâ€™t bethis giant winged thing, spindly like a crane fly,skinny-legged like me, kissing the cold ceiling, fumbling for the face of the other, seeking.It came in with me last night when I turned on the light.I lay awake, afraid it would touch my face.It wants out. I want out, too.
