Even the clerkleans into her tale, clucking softly. Whenpeople behind me cough, she won’t berushed. She’s got her whole story to go.Soon there’s a man she never married,her mother opposed, far away still, and hewent into a bar, wrong place, wrong color,wrong words, maybe, a good man.He’ll never come away of there, not comin’home, geraniums on the back porch,and not replace the bad tire her Honda has,who could always be telling her what timedoes in the kitchen if she stand halfnaked letting his dog go on out. Solet me pay you for him, give you moneybecause you is nice and I remember,her nearly singing voice sighs. The sleevedpants, two shirts hang on the brass ring, allfinished, unclaimed, the stiffenedstains gone away. The perfectly starchedcloth a redemption so beautifulit might be the linen of royalty, but smallfor a man two of us will think of as sleep scuffs house walls like tide under a boat.How nice they are, these women doingthe little one person can for anotherwhich is, in the end, a washof memorable words that leave you standing.
