Here is what                                                 I know for sure:Was a gift from one city to another. A citycannot travel to another city, a city cannot visit any city but itself, and in its sadness it gives        away a great door in the air. Well         a city cannot except for Paris, who putson a hat styled with pigeon wings and walksthrough the streets of another city and will noteven see the sights, too full she is of the sightsalready. And within her walk her women,         and the women of Paris looking like         they just walked through an Arch...        Or am I mixing it up I think I am with another famous female statue? Bornin its shadow and shook-foil hot the factsslid off me also. I and the Arch we burnedto the touch. “Don’t touch that Arch a boywe know got third-degree burns from touch-        ing that Arch,” says my mother sittingfor her statue. She is metal on a hilltop andso sad she isn’t a Cross. She was long agogiven to us by Ireland. What an underhand        gift for an elsewhere to give, a door that reminds you you can leave it. She raises        her arm to brush my hair. Oh no femalearmpit lovelier than the armpit of the Arch.
