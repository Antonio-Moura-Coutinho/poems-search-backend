
I was born as a woman, I talk you to death,                                                   or else your ear off,or else you to sleep. What do I have, all the timein the world, and a voice that swings brass backand forth, you can hear it, and a focal point wheremy face should be. What do I have, I have absolutepower, and what I want is your money, your drool,and your mind, and the sense of myself as a snake,and a garter in the grass. Every bone in the snakeis the hipbone, every part of the snake is the hips.The first sound I make is silence, then sssssshhh,          the first word I say is listen. Sheep shearers                      and accountants hypnotize the hardest,and lookout sailors who watch the sea, and the boyswho cut and cut and cut and cut and cut the grass.The writers who write page-turners, and the writerswho repeat themselves. The diamond-cutter kneelsdown before me and asks me to hypnotize him, andI glisten at him and glisten hard, and listen to me andlisten, I tell him. Count your age backward, I tell him.Become aware of your breathing, and aware of mine                         which will go on longer. Believe you           are a baby till I tell you otherwise, then believeyou’re a man till I tell you you’re dirt. When a gunshotrings out you’ll lie down like you’re dead. When you          hear, “He is breathing,” you’ll stand up again.The best dog of the language is Yes and protects you.The best black-and-white dog of the language is Yesand goes wherever you go, and you go where I say,you go anywhere. Why do I do it is easy, I am workingmy way through school. Give me the money                           for Modernism, and give me the moneyfor what comes next. When you wake to the fact that youhave a body, you will wake to the fact that not for long.When you wake you will come when you read the wordhard, or hard to understand me, or impenetrable poetry.When you put down the book you will come when youhear the words put down the book,                                              you will come when you hear.
