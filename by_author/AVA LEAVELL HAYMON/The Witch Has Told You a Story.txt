You will take himeggs with yellow sauce, muffinstorn apart and leaking butter, fried meatslate in the morning, and always sweetsin a sticky parade from the kitchen.His vigilance, an ice pick of   hungerpricking his insides, will meltin the unctuous cream fillings.He will forget. He will thank youfor it. His little finger stuck every daythrough cracks in the barswill grow sleek and round,his hollow face swelllike the moon. He will stop dreamingabout fear in the woods without food.He will lean toward the mawof   the oven as it opensevery afternoon, sighingbetter and better smells.
