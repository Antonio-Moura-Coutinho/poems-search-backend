
Complete in ourselves,
we look like scraps of paper anyway:left alone, we could tell
our mothers and one another our owners’flimsiest secrets and play together all dayuntil we became intertwined, which is why
you tryto keep us permanently apart.
One of us is a gossamer pirate ship,a frigate whose rigging the industrialsunset highlights, sail by oblong sail.
Another resembles a Greek letter — gamma,or lambda; others still
a ligature, a propeller, a fat lip.Our will is not exactly the wind’s will.
Underlined by sand,whose modes of coagulation and cohabitation
none of the human pedestrians understand,
we take off on our almost arbitrarilylengthy singletons of stringtowards the unattainable, scarily
lofty realm of hawk and albatrossand stay, backlit by cirrocumulus.It seems to be up to you
to keep usup in the air, and to make sure our paths never cross.
