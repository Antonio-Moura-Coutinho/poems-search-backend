when you were reversing for me          on the slope at home.Racing greenit sits for scrap now
on the tow truck.
Majestic as a king
on his lecticathe ratchets clickthe blue straps tightenbefore the final journeyout the gates
through which it oncefirst drove
purchased from our savingswhen we were toldwe were having twins.
Ground-in chocolate, mud, crumbs
infant seats all straps and bucklesthe roof rack bars were your horizontal
handles when you’d standand, like the Hulk, begin to shake
us when you’d come to say goodbye.
And the strapped-in children wouldshout as if they were about to be tipped
out, and when you stopped, their laughterturned to Do it again! Go on, do it again!I once knew a woman who drove a convertible:
metallic navy, white leather interior, gloss veneer
fabric, reclining roof.A thing of  vehicular beauty.
When she sold it she never wrote a poem.
