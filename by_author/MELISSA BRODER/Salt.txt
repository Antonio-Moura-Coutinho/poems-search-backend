
How can you go swimming in another human being?I am swimming and asking for light.Once I paddled into dust and fuckingand the horsemen and ruinand the poisonous hollows of a projected blue eyeand cracked my skull on all and caught more diseasein my already dread mind and entered the medicinesof no human power, the forests of disappearing moans,which were rich in sap but lacked dissolvefertilized against my own swimming nature, AlephI am swimming for you now and I donâ€™t care.When you leave the forest you do not become the oceanand I have become the desert trying to swim in the oceanand knowing this, carrying the forest floor in a sweet wood coffinand the blackbrush and rocks, the yucca and cacti of receded oceans,which were never oceans at all or there would have been shells on the sand,they only looked like oceans in my thirst, I cut the old horizonwith a sword you have given and I gut the heavensand bleed their light and swim in that.
