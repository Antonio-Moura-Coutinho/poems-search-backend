The general theme was prevenient grace.But the white rim broke his form, and he hit the bathtub water like a big charred bough of a tree.A semicircle of his shoes—Oxfords, monk straps,bluchers, a lone boot—crowded in to get a look.After that, Morphy was only surface. You can lookinto anything and see what you want. For example,Pierre swore he could read stock returnsin the little channels of Morphy’s pruned thumbs.He even called in Schiaparelli’s niece. She enteredwith a shoe on her head, I swear. There are pictures,look it up. My uncle, my unfortunate uncle,says the whole event—Morphy in the tub—lookedfloral, with shoe petals. Just to be difficult, I said“saucer of milk”: a teacup on a dish, alone in thequiet, waiting for a cougar to come by. Ialways bank on something parched and amblingto make my point. Or else something with abroken heel, covered in wet newspaper andhuddled up next to the highway. All thumbs.
