
Too hot torest, I tossmy arms off
the bed. My night-gown wet withsweat. I feel you
— a sack ofscavenged skullson my chest
— sippingthe salt frommy breasts. Imp.
Incubus. Im-pulse. You andme like a mare
that must bebroken inby breaking in-
to. Tamed ishow fire isby giving itself
something to destroy:it destroys it-self. But who
can deter-mine what’s insideanother?
What is riskedwhen we enter    ...    Caliper. Forceps.
Scalpel. Oculus.Perhaps you’rethe wilderness
that waits with-in me. Perhaps another mystery, I
open beneathyou. Yoked. Harnessed.Paralyzed.
At once a-wake and a-sleep. I nay.
I knockover the kerosenelamp. Light of
the rationalmind snuffed. Shadowof shadows.
Because I can’tsee, I sense.Your thumb
thrummingmy mouth. Acommand. Arch-
angel. Visionof invasion.Insemination.
My horseheart beatingwith yours.
