And now                                                                          this dog — thatI mostly call Sovereignty, both for how sovereignty,like fascination, can be overrated, and for how long it’staken me, just to half-understand that. Pretty much mywhole life. Mortality seemed an ignorable wilderness like any other; the past seemed what, occasionally, it still does, a version of luck when luck, as if inevitably, gets stripped away: what hope, otherwise, for suffering? When did honesty become so hard to step into and stay inside of, I’m not saying                                              forever, I could last a fair time on a small while. Sovereignty sleeps hard beside me. I pass my hands down the full length of him, like a loosecommand through a summer garden. Let those plantsthat can do so lean away on their stems, toward the sun.
