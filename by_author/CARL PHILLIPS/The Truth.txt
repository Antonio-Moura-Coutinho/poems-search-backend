
And now,
the horse is entering   
the sea, and the sea
                               holds it.   
Where are we?
Behind us,   
the beach,
                yes, its
scrim,
          yes, of
                      grass, dune, sky—Desire
goes by, and though
it’s wind of course making   
the grass bend,
                        unbend, we say   
it’s desire again, passing
us by, souveniring us with   
gospel the grass, turned
choir, leans into,
                           Coming—
Lord, soon.
