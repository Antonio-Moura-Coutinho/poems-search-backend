Prologue
If the sea could dream, and if the sea   
were dreaming now, the dream
would be the usual one: Of the Flesh.   
The letter written in the dream would go   
something like: Forgive me—love, Blue.

    I. The Viewing (A Chorus)O what, then, did he look like?
                                                   He had a good body.And how came you to know this?
                                                 His body was naked.Say the sound of his body.
                                             His body was quiet.Say again—quiet?
                            He was sleeping.You are sure of this? Sleeping?
                                                   Inside it, yes. Inside it.

    II. Pavilion
Sometimes, a breeze: a canvas   
flap will rise and, inside,   
someone stirs; a bird? a flower?
One is thinking Should there be
thirst, I have only to reach   
for the swollen bag of skin
beside me, I have only to touch
my mouth that is meant for a flower   
to it, and drink.
