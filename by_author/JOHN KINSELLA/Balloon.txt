Tracy tells me a professorof economics at a local city universitywhile praising capitalism says he will onlylisten to opposition if it comes from onewho eats only lentils, has given up carsand eschews imported brands of foodstuffs. Lentils?Contradictions aside, I’ll take him on, thoughit might be hard to hear me speak above the juniorquad-bike circus performing along the hills. But hark,I’ll tell you something unusually usual: at duskwandering the block with Katherine we came acrossshreds of chemical-pink balloon with plastic stringattached to its tied-off umbilical cord, clearlyan escapee from a party, the child—her namedecorating the balloon with three crosses for kisses—in tears, chasing it up into the sky, watchingit drift over the hills, her letter to the worlda single word and her mark made over. Katherine asks if I recall the balloons her class back in England released with school name and address and how onefloated all the way over the Channel and on to Belgiumwhere another child picked up the shreds and decipheredthe message and wrote back; weather balloons, “hopesand ambitions” as Delmore says, but without doubtor skepticism, in full expectation they will landsomewhere far away and bring joy to the finder.I throw the shred of balloon away, fearingan animal crossing the block in the dark,night-eyed and keenly sampling the groundand the air with its snout, will reread or misread the code of chemical pinkness, and like some Red Riding Hood in reverse, choke on the gift of chance.
