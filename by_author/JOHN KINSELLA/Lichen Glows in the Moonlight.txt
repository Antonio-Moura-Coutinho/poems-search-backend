Then passed by,recharged it leaps up off rocksand suffocates—there is no routethrough rocks without having to confrontits beseeching—it lights the way,not the moon, and outdoes epithetslike phosphorescent, fluorescent, or florescent:it smirks and smiles and lifts the cornerof its lips in hideous or blissful collusion,and birds pipe an eternal dawn, never knowing when to sleep or wake. They might be tricked into thinking their time’s up,in the spectrum of lichen, its extra-gravitalpersuasion, its crackling movementremembered as still, indifferent, barelyliving under the sun, or on a dark night;climbing up you’d escape, but like all greatmolecular weights it leaves tracesyou carry with you into the realms           of comfort and faith.
