Is he conflicted, does heperceive the sky oscillating like a dimmer machine, a mouth, a war, languagenot declaring its mosteffective self, bellum grazing evernearer to beauty, a possible apotheosis how what is left of senseis comfort. Not inebriated much anymore,I rented a lawn to stand in with you, crueler was always singing to our mutual forks,knives. Our translation of a subject droneson unblinking, something black for himreturning, his forearms there laidthemselves down, ships gone out another pale-plated night.
