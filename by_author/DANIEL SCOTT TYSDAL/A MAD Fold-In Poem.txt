At times,your voice is constant — “kill yourself, kill yourself, killyourself” — fists punching clay with the aim to make menothing more than punched clay. Other times, you’rea cinema in my skull, screening me mangled: one leg  auger-mauled, hand vice-crushed, eye pencil-blinded to life — “end it,” you say, in the scene you loop: this cinema’s wallswith a bullet burst. At parties, you shape a sinister play fromothers’ glances: “hate him,” “idiot,” “fool.” When I bloom,
 a sun, all alight and rising, you flatten my lift into lineson a page like Jaffee’s in the back of MAD; you fold itover and now the rise is the wound from a wing cleaved   and then gilded, the bloom’s a thousand-foot fall, the suna drain. Yet with each step the unrelenting chorus of youcircles round me, another chorus surfaces to surround you: the  line of sheltering trees artists grow, loamy and ablaze, against  your gale, the melodies of friends whose works asphyxiate yoursymphony, the lessons students teach about tipping yourplinths, the magic of  bringing nib to page and penning lifewith urgency and patience, word by word, with abandon
 and care. Even though I know it can never silence you, I lovethis inky trick because it fills the blank before you can, marksup your script, swallows you choking in a page-mutatingfold, so your cruel barks, garbled, almost seem to say:A ▶                                                                                                          ◀ B
