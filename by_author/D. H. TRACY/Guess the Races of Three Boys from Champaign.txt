Riding as though and as thoughon an animal (maybe his bikeshould have gazelle eyes) he is hatching planssomehow angelically pristine of doubtbetween them and fruition. He dumpsthe bike on this side of the jungle gyms,while cottonwood foam blows up from the branch,and wind imparts the grass two sibling greens,and parents show their callow half-formed centerscajoling children. He is alone, and setshimself to picking clover; whole minutes passwhen all he does is increase one bouquetof grass-high nondescript white clover blossoms.There must be a million in the fieldnot in his hand. He lays the fistful downand takes a roofing nail out of his pocket,and with it and his eldritch patience awlsthrough-holes in his foam-grips. He twists the stemsinto a stalk he tapers, pinches off,and jams into the handlebars, onlyto watch the blossoms fall apart and over.He tries and fails again, incredulousnow the ornament he planned as thoughdesigning a contraption, some trebuchetor hovercraft half-specified and magic,will not work on mere enthusiasm.His tantrum comes on suddenly, a spasticlittle stomping dance across the grass,and ends without his having made a sound.He is off the way he came. They arenot brutal, the feebly dreamt surrounding houses,crops striving in the dirt, child-rearing habitslapsed and current, like childhood diseases.The bric-a-brac on his bedroom floor that damnshim to time. But neither are they tenderof that thing his paltry ruined posy,the fanning homely crumbs of perfect whim,is evidence of.                                  2The hangdog rookie lifeguard shuffles inalready delegated an action iteminvolving a stepladder, a spray bottle,and a biohazard bag. The dimguttering aura of his authoritytries to fill the locker room, as doesthe smell of sock, and calms imperfectlythe preteens disobeying rule elevenregarding horseplay. The kid attains the utmost,handicapable shower stall, yanksthe curtain and deploys his ladder, ascendingthree rungs of his portable Golgothaand staring as though straining to make outSt. Paycheck in a stained glass window. The bottleand empty plastic sack slump at his sides,props whose ritual has slipped his mind,or tools of tradesman or physician agapeat a humdinger, for damned if not nine feetup the cinder blocks, improbablymassive, glistening, and cantilevered,there does not jut a load of crap. He says,almost quietly, already showingawareness of those situations whereresort to melodrama will not help,but still somehow reluctant to let goof being someone singled out by fate,“You have got to be motherfucking kidding me.”No poo-flinger or projectile buttortitters from the bench. The sun, supremelysupercilious in the skylights, mums;the ceiling fans the shit perhaps was aimed atspin an rpm too fast for one to follow.The dented cubby rows and columns retainthe continence of safe-deposit boxes.If he does not punch out and not come back,the lifeguard shall be our savior in wayswe scarcely dreamt or paid him for, thinkingall he had to do was watch our children.As for the mystery of whether oneis being kidded, it is his to bear.No ceo of pooldom makes that much.                                  3The corner drugstore lends the cause a spigot;the cause runs hoses to the parking lot,and proto-nubile junior-high girls lureout of the intersection, by sign and banner,ten perverts an hour. Shucked garden-snail of an errand-runner, five dollars gets youa sort of car wash, and gets the wrestling teamcloser to their travel fund objective.Small talk with the game and patient coachwill pleasantly derail you, as the squadswarms with half-grasped purpose in your service.One is dutiful and has a bucket.One is cheery with a rag. The rowdybuck for the nozzle, the second-rowdiestfleeing when one prevails: rinser-offof quarter panels and future quarterbacks,broad-shouldered as though tapped for it, as thoughfor violin or chess. Can he see,from where he is, the rainbow that he issues,the laughter-stippled day convened for himand his? Days to come he is hawkingtwo-dollar Jujubes out of a knapsackin the alley by the multiplex;there fall to him the odd, ambivalentvagina-samplings behind the Sonic Burger,and on his cast the day he tries to olliethe planters at the bank, a turquoise heartto dot the i in Brandi. We are goingto be all right; good supervisors abound;our grab-ass shall be moderated, and thosewho tsk are bound to say I knew you when.We need be lots of things, but never lonely.
