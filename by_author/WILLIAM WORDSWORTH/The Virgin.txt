
Mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrostWith the least shade of thought to sin allied.Woman! above all women glorified,Our tainted nature's solitary boast;Purer than foam on central ocean tost;Brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewnWith fancied roses, than the unblemished moonBefore her wane begins on heaven's blue coast;Thy image falls to earth. Yet some, I ween,Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend,As to a visible Power, in which did blendAll that was mixed and reconciled in theeOf mother's love with maiden purity,Of high with low, celestial with terrene!
