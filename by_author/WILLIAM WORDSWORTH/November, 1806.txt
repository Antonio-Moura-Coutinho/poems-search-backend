
Another year!—another deadly blow!Another mighty Empire overthrown!And We are left, or shall be left, alone;The last that dare to struggle with the Foe.'Tis well! from this day forward we shall knowThat in ourselves our safety must be sought;That by our own right hands it must be wrought;That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low.O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!We shall exult, if they who rule the landBe men who hold its many blessings dear,Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,Who are to judge of danger which they fear,And honour which they do not understand.
