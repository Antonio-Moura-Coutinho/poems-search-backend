Her skirt was a swoopof ink, his hand invisible in an undrawn pocket.Circles make up the majority of the face. We are all circlesand planar suggestion. If  the girl wants to be a horseshe need only walk into the outline of oneand line up her body with the chest. We’ll fill inthe rest, and before you know it, she’s a natural.Who will ride her? The boy doesn’t know how.He has a hankering to sketch in a saddle.When she tosses her head, he mocks up a bridle.He mocks her. A bridle for a bride, he says,which doesn’t seem like what little boys say,but he wasn’t so little, and she didn’t run away.
