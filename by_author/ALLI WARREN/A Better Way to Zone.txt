
Habits accrue
in circular pattern
and living occasion
swollen among what
the dead have to teach us
 
So, ear, be an instrument for thought
Tide, bring some
little green thing to dust
behind my eyes
 
Touch the hotpoint
and drag the tongue
over the fat belly
of a flapping fish
 
Sticker book
of farm animals
Sticker book of ole timey cats
What is life and how shall it be governed?
 
With blind devotion
and endurance in the impossible
for guts in everything for roots
in plain sight
 
Share a lung
Accumulate none
Say hello to the crow
 
There are certain chord progressions
one should avoid
