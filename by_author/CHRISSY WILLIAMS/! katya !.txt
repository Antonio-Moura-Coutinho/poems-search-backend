  to dress ! how i want to dress ! like a gale !     full of glitter ! and back alleys ! a seagull
laugh ! to shake our being ! whose secret lies !
  perhaps ! in kicking legs upwards in delight !
       painted ! an omnivorous harpy ! goofy !
  loving our friends ! lighting up around them !
  what a man ! unstoppable ! they’ll say, why !
 they’re the perfect woman ! (now that’s me !)
    judy jetson ! enraged ! with a penis ! and
obsessed with Contact too ! in every situation !
       a little Jodie Foster ! o dear role modelfor my role model ! find meaning ! play parts !
  everything real ! happens ! behind the eyes !
 all those things we cannot prove ! like love !
  like the world ! is just ! what we make of it
