On into the soaring, black release.                                               •The messages say syllabus and vetting thatand will be absent. Nothing.On into the what? the air you’re gliding onor falling from,                              the wind of it makingahs and salves in the hollow of your chest,Celina of a bodily sibilance like willows, of the shimmering, midsummer glance.You would allow yourself a message.How to make it low-key. How to keep it to a few lines.                                               •On into the wind of whatever is happening.What leashes you seems to have come undone.You lean down into the white heap of black words.You pad out toward the water fountaininto someone’s eyeshadowed look, the lush backwash of her skirt.You weigh maybe three or fourounces, swirling down the stairwellin whichever wind this is, your ribsaching with what theysing so shamelessly.
