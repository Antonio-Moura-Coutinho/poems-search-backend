
Another day come, add it To the list, theNot to do list.Son of mine,I was rambling across the undercarpetingStrewn with imperceptible tacksIn one shapeless slip-onWhen a pain rang out in my flankAnd I fell to,Braying,But who should answer but no one.I lost good cause that day, don’t ask,Let us sit a bit in this ill-starredSuit in the form-fillingChamber of subtraction,Listing.I haven’t another trip around the sun Left in me. Speak to meSon, vague one. For this is where it thickens,Me here and it there and me there and them hereAnd you with the soul.I’ll cross that gravid boneyard All the day poking Radishes for remembrance.For this is a private matter Between a man and his scaffoldingAnd it shall remain so Privation permitting.
