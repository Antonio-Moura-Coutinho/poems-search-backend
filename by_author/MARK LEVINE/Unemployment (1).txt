
I had a calling.I took the call.It was all I could do to follow the voice streaming into meLike traffic on the runway where I layDown to gather.I had a calling. I heard the geese bleatIn the firmament as they migratedInto the jet’s jets.And could I have foreseen that fallingI could have fallen tooRather than being sutured to the bottomlessFreeze-out lake.For it is fine to lie within one’s borrowed blanketsLooking up at the Dropped ceiling coming down.For at the moment I am employed counting the holesIn the sound absorbing tilesKeeping a running record of the interlocutor’s Chides.I feel at one with extinctionBy my own hand(Inner hand)Though once there were many of my kindFlocking inland, or perhapsIt felt that way.
