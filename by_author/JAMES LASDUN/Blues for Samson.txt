She leans in, letting her breastbrush against me. She knows her middle-aged man;playing me like some trailer Delilah,and I feel it rise;the old bluntwant-instrumentthat always and only wanted what it shouldn’t;Gaza, Timna, my Valley girlwho spilled me in broad daylight. I must have reckonedthe sun shone out of her cunt.Too long nowbereft of it,a woman’s hands in my hair, or what’s left of it,is all I seem to require of love, and all I’ll spill is a tip, Dee; big as my straitenedcircumstances allow,for Dee, once my head wasn’t bareas that cornfield after the foxes I set on firerampaged through it, or the orchards and olive grovesI flattened with my slat-armored D9 ’dozer,but maned like a lion’s.
