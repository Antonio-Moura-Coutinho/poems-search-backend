
It’s a little-known fact that God’s headgear — A magician’s collapsible silk top hat,When viewed from Earth, from the bottom up — Is, sub specie aeternitatis,A pluperfect halo, both circle and square,And a premonition of this truthSpurred on an ancient philosopher,Anaxagoras, to make numerous vainAttempts to approximate the circleOf his concerns with the square of the cellHe was jailed in for impiety.Doomed calculations which God acknowledgedBy doffing then pancaking his topper.He was still bareheaded millennia later,When he learned of von Lindemann’s proof that piIs not the root of a polynomialWith rational coefficients, henceSquaring the circle’s impossible.God un-collapsed, re-donned his hat!But — it was 1882,Progress was a juggernautAnd the public had no patience for “proof.”From below, God’s gesture looked like a signalFor all hat- and cap-wearing men,Proper in their headgear, for nations,Well-stocked with helmets for delicate brainwork,To take up “the compass and straightedge”And prepare for a singular all-out attackOn this seductive conundrum, so men Enlisted en masse in Geometry’s army,Tossing up and away all hatsOf cloth, opaque haloes, hurray!
