
Come March we’d find them In the five-and-dimes, Furled tighter than umbrellas About their slats, the airIn an undertow above usLike weather on the maps. We’d play out linesOf kite string, tugging againstThe bucking sideways flights. Readied for assembly,I’d arc the tensed keel of balsa Into place against the crosspiece,Feeling the paper snap  Tautly as a sheet, then lift The almost weightless body Up to where it hauled meTrolling into the winds— Knotted bows like vertebrae Flashing among fieldsOf light. Why ruin itBy recalling the aftermaths? Kites gone down in tatters, Kites fraying like flotsam From the tops of the trees.
