The trainsighs open at Burlingame,past dark tons of scrap and water.I carry you down the black steps.Burlingame is the size of joy:a race past bakeries, gold ringsin open black cases. I donâ€™t carewho sees my crooked smileor what erases it, past the bakery,when you tire. We ride the blades againbeside the crooked bay. You smile.I hold you like a hole holds light. We wear our hats and ride the knives.They cannot fix you. They try and try.Tunnel! Into the dark open we go.Days you are sick, we get dressed slow.
