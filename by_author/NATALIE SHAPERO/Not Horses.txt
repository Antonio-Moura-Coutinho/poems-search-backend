What I adoreis a bug that lives only one day, especially ifit’s a terrible day, a day of train derailment orchemical lake or cop admits to cover-up, a daywhen no one thinks of anything else, least of allthat bug. I know how it feels, born as I’ve beeninto these rotting times, as into sin. Everybody’sbusy, so distraught they forget to kill me,and even that won’t keep me alive. I sharemy home not with horses, but with a little dogwho sees poorly at dusk and menaces stumps,makes her muscle known to every statue.I wish she could have a single day of   language,so that I might reassure her don’t be afraid —our whole world is dead and so can do you no harm.
