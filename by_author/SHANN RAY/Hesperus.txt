
My four-year-old daughter handed me a card. To Daddy written on the frontand inside a rough field of  five-pointed lights, and the wordsYou’re my favorite Daddy in the stars.In this western night we all light the skylike Vega, Deneb, Altair, Albireo, the Summer Triangle, Cygnus the Swan, our hair tangled with wood and gravel, our eyes like vacant docksthat beckon every boat.Tell me about the wordstars, I said.Oh, she said. Sorry. I didn’t knowhow to spell world.
