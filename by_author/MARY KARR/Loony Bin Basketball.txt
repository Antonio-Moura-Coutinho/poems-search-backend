The gym opened out before us like a vast arena, the bleached floorboardsyawned toward a vanishing point, staggered seats highas the Mayan temple I once saw devoured by vines.Each of us was eaten up inside — all citizens of   lost             and unmapped cities.Frank hugged the pimply ballover his belly like an unborn child. Clairedressed for daycare in daffodil yellow and jelly shoes.David’s gaze was an emperor’s surveying a desiccatedbattlefield. Since he viewed everything that way, we all            saw him the same.The psych techs in Cloroxed whitewere giant angels who set us running drills, at whichwe sucked. The zones we set out to defend were wateryat every edge. We missed close chest passes, easy combos. Our metronomes run different tempos,             John proclaimed. Then Claire started seeing dashes stutter through the air behind the ball.Then speed lines on our backs, and then her own head went wobbly as a spinning egg. She’d once trackedplanetary orbits for NASA and now sat sidelined            by her eyes’ projections. Only Bill had game.Catatonic Bill whose normal talent was to schlubdays in a tub chair — his pudding face scarredwith chicken pox — using his hand for an ashtray,belly for an armrest. Now all that peeled away, and he             emerged, clean as an egg. He was a litheand licorice boy, eeling past all comers, each shotsheer net. He faked both ways, went left. Beneath the orange rim his midair pirouettes defied the gravity that Icould barely sludge through. He scored beyond what even             Claire could count,then he bent panting,hands on knees as the orderlies held out water cups,and the rest of us reached to pat his back or slaphis sweaty hand, no one minding about the stench or his breath like old pennies. Then as quick as that             he went.Inside his headsome inner winch did reel him back from the frontof   his face bones where he’d been ablaze. He went back and back into that shadowed stare. Lucky we were to breathehis air. Breath is God’s intent to keep us living. He was             the self   I’d come inwanting to kill, and I left him there.
