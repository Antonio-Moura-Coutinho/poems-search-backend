
there are fat wet vines creeping into myhouse through the pipes and throughthe walls gentle as blue flames they curl into
my living there is ice in my attic sugar on mytile I am present and useless like a nose tornfrom a face and set in a bowl whenI saw God I used the wrong pronounsGod bricked up my mouthholehis fists were white as gold there wereroaches in my beard now I live like a widow
every day a heave of knitting patternsand sex toys my family speaks of mewith such pride noonesh to roghane they sayhis bread is in oil I thank them for that andfor their chromosomes most of whichhave been lovely I am lovely too my bodyis hard and choked with juice like a plasticthroat stuffed with real grapes my turn-onsinclude Ovid and fake leather my turn-offs have all been ushered into the base-
ment Iâ€™ll drink to them and to any victorythe vines are all growing toward the footof my bed I am waiting for them to come
under the covers I am the only person still inthis house there is no one here to look away
