
Bless Tuesday, blessed Monday.
Bless the word week, its seven
small days trail with y.
Bless the men whose words
I was too young to hear.
A whisper loves a canal.
Bless my laugh, lent by grief,
I have so little left to borrow.
But my hair, it grows—
if hair be gold, cut mine so
I might rid my beloved
of his student loans. Bless
thieves, universities, those
hands caress what’s not theirs.
Bless thinking it was yours.
Here are hands, blessed one.
Bless them holding the door.
Bless each crier on the F
train before and after me
as they blush, as they transfer
into tunnels for the red line.
Oh bless, bless wildly, what
remains to be done. Bless
the one who told me so,
the ones who didn’t.
Even weak breaths bless.
Bless weakness, fragile fortress,
my friend’s body absent
of soundness. Bless the sound
of someone reliable answering
your call, saying If you’re going
through hell, Hello.
