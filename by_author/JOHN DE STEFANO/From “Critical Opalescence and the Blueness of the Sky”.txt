
Shrugging shallowly down, burrowingin beneath the heaps of plumped cork- and sallow-brown leaf, beneath the oak and the brittle bean-dripping locust and the still so innocent fruit trees—bare-boughed and newly blossoming—skinnilyshadowing the frost-seared grasses, I and my “now” [in this pictured perfect] four-year-old daughter, huddled, hidden, lielow. I remember hiding in the forttoo: bedtimes once how snug among books and the plush beasts we spoke the speech of angels. Now the world is huge-ly hushed. The winter sky is hard, kiln-firedblue. The cherry wood retouched with buds. And small,untimely flowers like blood-drops on the snow. • Time lapsed. Time dwelt. There was nothing apparently to those rumors of rescue or reprisals. Absence onlyemptied the mind. The fond heart feltlight—likewise lifted right and justly upto praise the day as it was to highheaven. You were a “find”: rare, rose-lipped, hennaed, ochred, kohled, long black-stockinged O like one of Schiele’s urewiggirls, flashing a shy semaphore—spelling eloquently out the f-word, tenderly revisiting its history.Lust—like love lost—was the catalyst:exquisitely expedient, unchanged.
