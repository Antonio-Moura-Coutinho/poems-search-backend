Two holes at the top—near where the stem was,for a thong of leather to hang it by, which long ago broke—are now the fingerholes of the mournful wind instrument it’s become.The broad round bowl of it makes a sort of birdlybasso profundo that pearls through the steel, into the post,the floor joists and walls in two notes: a slightly sharp Dand an equally sharp F, says the guitar tuner,which explains why all my thinking these daysis in B-flat, a difficult key for all but the clarinetand this sudden covey of nuthatches, whose collective woemakes it a minor chord I am in the middle of.Nothing to do but hoist such silks as the luffof limbs and needles suggests, and sail on,the barely-escaped-from-the-cat chipmunk chatteringlike a gull, and the mountain’s last drift of snowresembling the back of a sounding whale. Hear the thrum of the rigging,Daggoo? Hear its profoundest woo, its sensible gobbledy-gooand doo-wop, the boo-hoos of the spheres, by vectors and veers,by tacks and refractal jabberings, taking us deeper into the weirdnessof the ghost sea those prairie hills were the bottom of once,this nowhere we shall not be returning from.Draw the lines! Assume the crow’s nest, Pip. This shipsails on music and wind, and away with birds.
