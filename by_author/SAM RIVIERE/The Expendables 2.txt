The airport where all movies end:the scenery’s mobile, the people too(the people want to be moved),and the rounded stairways join set pieceslike farewells in a series arc. I don’tunderstand how you write good scriptswithout knowing there are gods. I’velearned the same things we’ve all learned:when a man runs through my hotel suiteI can expect another half a second later.Also, tell me why I keep two keys,one of which unlocks something.Also, I know, we know, that you (hell-o)will have vanished before I finish saying thisand turn around. “You’ll do that,” I’ll mention to the night, and spin my swivel chair,perusing the moment’s sunkenness. Meanwhilemy antivirus angel is checking every file.We both know there’s a place you touchwhen your plane lifts off (I won’t say where),a little bolt that takes the plot apart,so closure is dismantled, because from hereyou can admit that nothing’s ever ended well.You have queued to show your documents.You have left behind your possessionsfor the kind scientists. The stairs have spunaway and sunk, and in losing your itineraryyour position is confirmed. Like, the first timea woman sees a diamond she just knows.
