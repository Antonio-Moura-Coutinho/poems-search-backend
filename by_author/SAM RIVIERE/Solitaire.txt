
I think I always liked the gamebecause it sounded like my namecombined with the concept of alone.(My name really does mean “alone”in Slovenian!) We don’t actually careif it’s true, but we want to knowthe person telling us is telling usthe truth. Say his name is “Hank,”as in, “of hair.” (It’s not.) My upbringingwas classically smooth/chaotic, apartfrom traumatic events I’ve never detailed,even to myself. Traumatic but methodical.But why say what happened even.In the tech block the blinds were downand I cleared my way to the final marbleunder the indistinct gaze of an indistinctmaster. My success had allowed meto become the bastard I always knewI could be. What did it mean, to cleanthe board like this, counting down to one?By these gradual and orderly subtractionsmy persona was configured. The goalwas to remain single. Sometimes telling youthe truth wouldn’t be telling you anythingmuch. For a while I’ve felt torpid and detuned,as if I want to share a view with you,so we can both be absent in one place.Look, the sky is beautiful and sour.I’m not here, too. I’m staring out of this cloudlike an anagram whose solutionis probably itself. I am only the methodthat this stupid game was invented to explain.
