
How many times
should I look at you and should
I change my life?
Monarch you makeyour orange assent to death.And how much dexteritycan you really teach me?Does your courageeven map onto theseworldly obligationsto friends, my job, desirefor a little affection in the latehours of the evening, etc.?I can't put myself ever in your head.But I can lieon your wing, with my left eye letting my right dart forward as you do.Don't ask somethingwith a lifespanhow to change your life.Ask something you can't believe ever lived.
