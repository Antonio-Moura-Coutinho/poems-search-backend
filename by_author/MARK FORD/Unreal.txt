and was surprised to see what looked like tea leaves at the bottom of the cup . . . minuteslater a great warm green wave or cloud began advancing towards me. “Look at the boats on his shirt,” I felt myself tryingto say, in Spanish, or Moroccan, yet knowing I knewnone of the words . . .                                            it was bright morning, and the train had arrivedand emptied at Chamartín before I finally pried open my eyes, and sawon the carriage floornothing but an unfamiliar pair of trainers: crackedwhite leather, with three green stripes. “Mister — or rather Herr — Adolf Dassler made these,” I thought. But whichof the two friendly men with whom I’d shared the carriage, and some wine,had been wearing them? I ponderedthis awhile, then fellasleep again . . .                              and did Herr Dassler visit, personally, all the cities inscribedon his trainers? Koln, Dublin, Paris, Montreal, Kopenhagen, Bern, Amsterdam . . . and fit the trainer to the city? Rom, like these, Vienna, London . . .                        Señor Dassler, I am dreaming of youon a bench on a platform in a train station in Madrid, unableto wake up, a pair of your trainers, that weren’t mine, but now are,on my feet . . .                                I am swimming, Herr Dassler, in your wake, though I fearyou are dead, a corpse washed clean by the numbing tides with three slanting stripes emblazoned on your chest, your passport and your wallet drifting to the ocean floor . . .                                                           I discoveredin a pocket — oh! the kindness of strangers! — about forty pesetas; but casting around for a joke or silver lining, I found nada — or niente, as I put itto my shoes . . . closing my eyes, I imagined fingers untying and easing off my Reeboks, as the train hurtled through the darkness, the men trying them on in turn, the ex-owner of these flexing his toes, padding up and down, nodding approval. They must have whispered like parents, as they lifted my shirt and unfastenedmy money belt, or perhaps, more like surgeons, they usedscissors, or a knife . . .                                              snicker-snack! I watchedthe vorpal blade tracearabesques across my breastbone, hover, then slidebetween two ribs. Chug-chugwent the trains. The heat was building, the potionat last wearing off. How light I’d be, I now began to reason, as quick and canny as a lizard, a perfectly camouflaged lizard, who’d shed a skin and acquired a new way of walking.
