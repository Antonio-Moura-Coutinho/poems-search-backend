
I butterflied Australian rack of lambwith shallots, garlic, parsley, butter, wine(some in the pan, some for the palate).Although the livestock loved in nursery rhymeavoided clumps of mint, it served my familynonetheless. I am no PETA zealot(leather jacket, handbag, wallet, shoes)but wonder if the deeds we do pursueus in the afterlife. Does the fleecycreature have a tenderable claim?My lambent mind considers our short leaseon life, the oven hot. Am I to blame?Who gave thee such a tender voice? asked Blake.Myself am Hell. I watch the mutton bake.
