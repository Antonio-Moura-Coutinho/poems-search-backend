Shoot them where they live and then skip town.Or stay and re-engineer the decrepit social contraptionto distill the 200-proofelixir of fearand torture the...the what from the what? And didn’t I promise,under threat of self-intubation,not to envision thiscorridor, coal-tar black,that narrows down and into a shattering claustrophobia attackbefore opening outto the lake of frozen shitwhere the gruesome figure is discerned?Turn around, go home.Just to look at it is to become it. 2. PURGATORY, THE FILM He was chronically out of work, why we don’t know. She was the second born of a set of estranged identical twins. They met,hooked up, and moved in with her mother,who managed a motel on Skyline Drive. But always it was the other,the firstborn, the bad twin, the runaway, he imagined in the shadowof the “Vacancy” signor watching through the windowbelow the dripping eaveswhile they made love or slept.The body is relaxed and at rest,the mind is relaxed in its nest,so the self that is and is not itself rises and leavesto peek over the horizon, where it seesall its psychokinetic possibilitiesresolving into shapely fictions.She was brave, nurturing, kind.She was evil. She was out of her mind.She was a junkie trading sex for a fix,a chief executive, an aviatrix.She was an angelto the blinded and the lamed,the less-than-upright, the infra dig.And she was even a failure.She went to L.A. to make it big and crept back home injured and ashamed.3. PURGATORY, THE SEQUELThey put him in jail, why we don’t know. They stamped him “Postponed.”But he didn’t mind.The screws were almost kind.He had leisure to get his muscles toned,mental space to regret his crimes,and when he wasn’t fabricating license plateshe was freeto remember the beautythat not once but a thousand timesescaped him forever, and escapes me, too:ghosts of a mist driftingacross the face of the stars,Jupiter triangulating with the crescent moon and Mars, prismatic fracturings in a drop of dew... 4. HEAVENThere’s drought on the mountain. Wildfires scour the hills.So the mammal crawls down the desiccated rillssearching for the fountain,which it finds, believe it or not,or sort of finds. A thin silver sliverrises from an underground riverand makes a few of the hotrocks steam and the pebbles hiss.Soon the mammal will drink,but it has first to stop and thinkits reflexive, impeccable thought:that thinking comes down to this—mystery, longing, thirst.
