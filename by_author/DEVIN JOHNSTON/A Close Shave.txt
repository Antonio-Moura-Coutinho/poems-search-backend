
From Baden, or what’s left of it,pursue a long, smooth curve of roadthat skirts the northern flood wallto parallel a palisadeof channel markers sunk in earth,the folly of a cement works.Its blank silos overlooka pit of argillaceous shale,the fine and fossilized remainsof bivalves, sponges, spines of shark,quarried and burnt with limestone chargeto alchemize a binder of brickand the city’s shallow, brittle crust.Around a bend, the riverbed swings wide to open a fetch of field.Shadows skim its mucky thawas juncos, whisked about by the windon courses neither fixed nor free,give but a quick metallic chink.Behind you, rain has wrapped the bluffsand scumbled limbs of sycamores.Ahead, each bend assumes the nameof a gaudy packet run aground,or snagged and sunk, or blown to bits:for one, the side-wheel Amazon,pluperfect wheelhouse painted green,that struck a honey-locust pikestill rooted deep in river mudand tore its hull from stem to stern.Down in minutes! Within the monthan island silted up behind.A flock of luggage floated south, remarked by those on Water Streetloafing before the trading postand the barbershop of Madame Krull.She can eternally be foundat work in her elaborate roomtoujours prêt to clip and coifor wield her razor with great skillfor those who favor her with their chins.The scent of ginger tonic blendswith that of borscht, its acrid tang,consumed behind a wooden screenas Illinois grows dark. In this,her second year since coming west.
