Liam the dandyloved Brooks Brothers shirts, double-breastedsuits, bespoke shoes, and linen jackets.On the day Liam and Tree marriedin our backyard, Liam and I woreChuck’s burgundy boho-prep high-topsthat Liam bought on Fifth Avenue.                               2When the rain started, we moved indoorsand Liam read a Quartet aloud.T.S. Eliot turned old and frailat sixty, pale, preparing for death.Then poets of new generationsdied—Frank O’Hara first, then Jim Wrightwith throat cancer in a Bronx hospice,Sylvia Plath beside the oven,Thom Gunn of an overdose, Denise                               3 Levertov, Bob Creeley, Jane Kenyon...In a New York bar, Liam told meeccentric, affectionate storiesabout a road trip in Tree’s countryof Montana, and the joy they feltin the abundance of their marriage.At Bennington Tree said, “Fourteen yearsafter the wedding in your backyard,I love Liam with my entire heart.”                               4Liam’s face changed quickly as he spoke,eyes and mouth erupting with gustoas he improvised his outrageous,cheerful, inventive obscenities.When I first met him—I expoundedat a young poet’s do—his beardedface was handsome and expressionless.He would not defer to a poetfifty years old! After a few months                               5he was revising my lines for me,making the metaphors I couldn’t.Even now, working at poems, Iimagine for a moment Liamdisassembling them. A year agohe watched the progress of age turn meskeletal, pale flesh hanging looselyin folds from my arms, and thin rib-boneslike grates above a sagging belly.                               6 His body would never resemblemy body. Four or five times a weekwe wrote letters back and forth, talkingabout class structure, about how Treetook charge over the Academyof American Poets, aboutpoems and new attacks on free speech...When I won a notorious prize,Liam sent me eighty-one notions                               7about projects I might undertake.Number fifty-six instructed me:“Urge poets to commit suicide.”His whole life he spoke of suicidelightly, when he wasn’t preservingthe First Amendment from Jesse Helms,or enduring two colon cancers,or watching films, or chatting with Tree,or undergoing heart surgeries.                               8If he walked their dog Keeper one block,he had to take nitroglycerin.When Jane was dying, Liam and Treedrove up to say goodbye. I wheelchairedJane to a pile of books by her chairto find the color plate of Caillebotte’sshadowy kitchen garden at Yerresfor the jacket of Otherwise, whenTree would design it. I think of Jane’s                                9horror if she were alive to knowthat on August fifteenth Liam pulledthe shotgun’s trigger. The night before,wearing a tux over a yellowsilk shirt, he danced with Tree once again,before bed and the morning’s murder.He left Tree alone and desolatebut without anger. Tree knew Liamdid what he planned and needed to do.
