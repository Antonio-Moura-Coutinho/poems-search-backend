The world fidgetsin uneasy relationship to our statementsabout it nevertheless producing silverbuds from ragged limbs like the lusterin late Frank Sinatra songs.

On those Chagallwindows you have to go through a gauntletof ancient armor to get to? What was her name,that night nurse so deft her blood drawsdidn’t wake me up? Don’t get me wrong, I wantto wake up. I want my old dog to show meall that wolf-light she hides insideeven though she thinks I won’t understand,even though her vet and I conspireto keep her alive forever.
