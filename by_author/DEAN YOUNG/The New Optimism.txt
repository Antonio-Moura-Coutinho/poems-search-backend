The young who knew everythingwas new made babies who unforeseeablywould one day present their complaint.Enough blame to go around but the newoptimism didn’t stop, helped onepick up a brush, another a spatulaeven as the last polar bear saton his shrinking berg thinking,I have been vicious but my soul is pure.And the new optimism loves the bear’s soul and makes images of it to sellat fair-trade craft fairs with laboriously knotted hunks of rope, photos of cheese,soaps with odd ingredients, whiskey,sand, hamburger drippings, lint,any and everything partaking of the glowingexfoliating cleanup. And the sealis sponged of oil spill. And the broken man is wheeled in a meal. War finallyseems stupid enough. You look an animalin the eye before eating it and the gloomyweather makes the lilacs grow. Hello,oceans of air. Your dead cat loves youforever and will welcome you forever home.
