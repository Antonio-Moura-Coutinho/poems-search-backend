She was pregnant,he didn’t have much intention, canvasesof crushed lightbulbs and screws in paste.He’d gotten fired from the lunch counterfor putting too much meaton the sandwiches of his friendsthen ended up in Macy’s in New Yorkselling caviar and she went homeI think to Scranton, two more versionsof never hearing from someone again.I’d like to say the most important fruitsare within but that’s the very sort of bullshitone goes to the peach farm to avoid,not just flight from quadratic equations,waiting for the plumber,finding out your insurance won’t pay.Everyone wants out of the spider’s stomach.Everyone wants to be part of some harvestand stop coughing to death and cursing at nothing and waking up nowhere nearan orchard. Look at these baskets,bashed about, nearly ruined with good employ.Often, after you’ve spent a day on a ladder,you dream of angels, the one with the trumpetand free subscriptions to the New Yorkeror the archer, the oink angel, angelof ten dollar bills found in the dryeror the one who welcomes you in work glovesand says if you’re caught eating a single peach,even windfall, you’ll be executed.Then laughs. It’s okay, kiddo,long as you’re here, you’re one of us.
