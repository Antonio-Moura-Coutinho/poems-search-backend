
Thou twist of gold, woven so curiously,Be filled with warmth and urgent tenderness,And cool not on her throat’s white nakedness,Like metal death, but burn insistently,Reminding her of me!To save her from the serpent’s little eyeI set a stone of blue chalcedonyWithin a cunning loop—so it shall beAware and mindful when her lashes lieUntaught of danger nigh.To keep her from the dragon’s hungry toothIn seven laps the quorls were subtly twined;From seven rivers grains of gold were mined,Hammered by black elves’ mauls, and tempered soothIn hissing brews uncouth.So lie within my satchel, Amulet,With many another dull and boughten thing,Till I am done with all my wanderingAnd fix thee pendant on the carcanetAround her white neck set.For I have graven some small incantationIn feathery lines upon this rounded wire—King Solomon made such for his desire,And Sheba’s throat was warm for subjugationHearing the King’s translation.
