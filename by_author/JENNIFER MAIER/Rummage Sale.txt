
Forgive me, Aunt Phyllis, for rejecting the cutglass dishes—the odd set you gathered pieceby piece from thirteen boxes of Lux laundry soap.Pardon me, eggbeater, for preferring the whisk;and you, small ship in a bottle, for the diminutivesize of your ocean. Please don’t tell my mother,hideous lamp, that the light you providedwas never enough. Domestic deities, do not be angrythat my counters are not white with flour;no one is sorrier than I, iron skillet, for the heavylonging for lightness directing my mortal hand.And my apologies, to you, above all,forsaken dresses, that sway from a rod betweenladders behind me, clicking your plastic tonguesat the girl you once made beautiful,and the woman, with a hard heart andsoftening body, who stands in the drivewaymaking change.
