
There is something men and women living in housesDon’t understand. The old alchemists standingNear their stoves hinted at it a thousand times.Ravens at night hide in an old woman’s shoe.A four-year-old speaks some ancient language.We have lived our own death a thousand times.Each sentence we speak to friends means the oppositeAs well. Each time we say, “I trust in God,” it meansGod has already abandoned us a thousand times.Mothers again and again have knelt in churchIn wartime asking God to protect their sons,And their prayers were refused a thousand times.The baby loon follows the mother’s sleekBody for months. By the end of summer, sheHas dipped her head into Rainy Lake a thousand times.Robert, you’ve wasted so much of your lifeSitting indoors to write poems. Would youDo that again? I would, a thousand times.
