
there, on the ground like dirt or a bird
december froze & may thawed, bloodmisted, crying for any mother, the boywho called your mama a bitch bleedsour love for you, his wings frozen & fighting
the cold wind of our sneakers.we storm him because we love you& your mama has fed us & only usis allowed to call her out her name
because we know her name, Ms. Jones,& she bad & only we can say that& when we bad she has permissionfrom our mamas to beat us like we hers.
we hers like you hers. you our boy.we pool our punches into the boylike quarters for a bag of flaming hots.we make him look like a bag of flaming hots.
lord forgive me, but i don’t regret it.&, on the real, all these summers later,i miss it. i wish a little bit to gather arounda man’s body & stomp in the name of love,
beat what he said about my next to bloodback into his vermilion mouth, to makehis mouth a beautiful, smashed tomato.really tho. Leland, you remember
how we beat that nigga? our middleschool ritual, that thirty-second eternity.later, i licked his blood off my nikes& dreamed we were water lilies
holding the water down.•
they were around me likenigga1nigga2      nigga3nigga4     me     nigga5nigga6       nigga7nigga8
& i felt    ...    safe?what could be saferthan a circle of boystoo afraid of killing youto kill you?
the fists that broke my ribs also wanted me to live.i praise each one true godfor each foot that was nota sharp anything.i had always wanted 8 niggas on me (but not) like that.
each hand laid upon me like a rude & starving prayer.after a while i started to           like iti leaned into it      unblocked my face
the bottoms of their shoes were the sweet of a well-chewed eraser.i was their promise. their ink.you should have heard them laugha language so delicious i cracked up cracked grin & all.
i didn’t know
a thing about love
until those boys
walked away
so happy.my heart pouring from my nose.
