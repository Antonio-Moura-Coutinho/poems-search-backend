Listen to lostuseless horses whingeing for home & hames, a lostgrail stuffed with dirt deaf to human legends long unstrung of sacred tune & lost, children prodded along in the loops of war,hopscotch mistake, the cast stoneskipped off the lake instead & lost the tournamentto the nice policeman there with the ice creamprecinct & his body buddy Dad. Dad declares he knowsby the spit & stripe of her this’s no one of his own, his kids mope, & he goes. Ear to ear I must look lucky at last, librarianat the dictionary of things looking-up ever sinceI hid in the glove box, pretending to be directions.
