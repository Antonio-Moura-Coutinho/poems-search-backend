She was mannish, Chilled, flungHer will acrossMine then laughedAt my shock, when sheGripped my neck whileLingering over a requestFor the evening meal. Later I sliced a tomatoClose to my wrist. The door was open. She had warned me: Never shut it againstHer. Otherwise I was free to come And go. Maybe she wasRight: I was zero To the bone. Meanwhile,I had left the hose In the pond. The goldfishCowered in the reeds. Whose side were they on?I am ill, I thought, Slogging acrossSoggy green.If I bow any lowerI will be looking upAt moss.
