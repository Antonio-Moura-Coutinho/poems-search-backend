
And fleetingly it seemed to himThat in between one eye blink and the nextTime paused, allowing time to be installedWithin that countless interim,Coiled up, on hold,A memory predicted and recalled.Now, that weak muscle flexed,All that contained him started to unfoldIn front of him, a moving bookIn three dimensions he could wander through,At will, at any point, now, since, before,To feel, to listen and to look—A house, or suiteOf rooms around a circling corridor,And waiting there, he knew,Were all the peopled days he’d not repeat.Slowly he stretched his hand to openThe first door on his right. Why, this was easy:Christmas when he was seven, and his auntPlaying a polonaise by Chopin,Badly. “Lenore,We know you think you can, dear, but you can’t.”And he was resting, queasyFrom too much pudding. Now, another door:So far, so faint, not yet an I,A pulse of sense, he hung upon a webOf knitted blood. Above, the muffled heartPerformed its mindless lullaby And in the wombHe slept on half awake. That was his partElsewhere, too, at the ebbOf his last consciousness. Another room:He recognized at once the faceOf one who five years hence he would have boundAs closely to him as a Siamese twin.How recklessly he would replaceThat loving care.Absorbed, now, in the dream of skin on skin,He whispered the profoundAnd destined promises she’d never share.He shuddered, shut it, and proceeded.So room on room, all of his scenes, arrangedIn simultaneous succession, playedBefore him, unignored, unheeded,Each a tableauVivant and drama, driven and yet stayed,Developing, unchanged.At last the time that paused for time to flowHe saw was coming to an end.He saw himself before himself, distinctAs when—a life ago—it came to himA single blink could comprehend,And then unfold,All time within that countless interim.He blinked. And then he blinked.And time continued as it coiled, on hold.
