In the Sonoran desertyour body became a slaughter-house where faith and want were stunned,hung upside down, gutted. We                                           were taughtto bring roses, to aim for the bush. Remember?You tried to porka girl’s armpit. In Border Patrol                                          jargon, the wordfor border crossers is the same whether                            they’re alive or dead.When I read his flesh felloff the bones, my stomach rumbled,                                                      my mouthwatered. Yesterday, our mother said,                           “My high heels are killing me.Let’s go back to the funeral.”                                           You were alwaysher favorite. Slow cooking a roastmelts the tough tissue between the muscle fibers;tender meat remains.                   Remember the timeI caught you pissing                              on a dog? You turnedaway from me. In the small of your backI thought I saw a face.                                         Split lip,broken nose. It was a mask.                            I yanked it from your flesh.               I wear it often.
