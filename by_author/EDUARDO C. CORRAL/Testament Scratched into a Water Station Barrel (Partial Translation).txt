Apá, dying is boring. To pass las horas,I carveour last nameall over my body.
I try to recall the taste of  Pablo’s sweat.Whiskey, no.Wet dirt, sí.I stuff  Englishinto my mouth, spit out chingaderas.Have it your way.Home of the Whopper.Run
for the border. ¡Aguas! The mirrorbetrayed us.It erased your facefrom my face.Gave me mother’s smile, narrow nariz.Once, I woreher necklace.The gold slick,
obscene. God, I was beautiful.Cada noche,I sleepwith dead men.The coyote was the third to die.Your moneyis still in his wallet.Quien engaña
no gana. Apá, there’s a foto, in my bolsillo,of a skeletonshroudedin black flames:Nuestra Señora de la Santa Muerte.Patron saintof smugglers, pick-pockets, & jotos.
La Flaca. Señora Negra. La Huesuda.¡Aguas!An animalis prowlingthis station. It shimmies with hunger.It shimmerswith thirst.To keep it away,
I hurl my memories at it. Your laughter is nowsnaggedon its fangs.Your painnow breathes inside its lungs. Tastethe feeling.Siempre Coca-Cola.America’s
real choice — I gathered & smashed bottles.Apá, followthe glasssnaking fromthe barrel to a mesquite to find my body.Lips blue,skin thickwith scabs.
Apá, kneel in the shade, peelthe scabs. Touchour last name.Solís.
