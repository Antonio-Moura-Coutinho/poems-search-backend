
That the dead are real to usCannot be denied, That the living are more realWhen they are deadTerrifies, that the dead can riseAs the living do is possibleIs possible to surmise, But all the stars cannot come nearAll we meet in an eye.Flee from me, fear, as sootFlies in a breeze, do not burn Or settle in my sight, I’ve tasted you long enough,Let me savorSomething otherwise.Who wakes beside me nowSuits my soul, so I turn to wordsOnly to say he changesInto his robe, rustles a page,He raises the lid of the pianoTo release what’s born in its cage.If   words come back To say they compromise Or swear again they have died,There’s no news in that, I reply,But a music without notesThese notes comprise, stillAs spring beneath us lies, Already something otherwise.
