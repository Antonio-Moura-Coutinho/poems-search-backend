When Miep took us home with herShe held us up in the air,Eye-level with those eyesYou may know, eyes spellingSorrow-girl, wait-for-me,Happiness-around-a-corner-One-day, hurry-back, don’t-tell.Two new hands took us in,Skin cradling skin.How empty we had been,Only a little bit worn —Not a penny, not a pebbleDwelling within.We became an altar,An offering red as wine,A wishing well.She was made to carry usNear and far,We were made to bearThe pressure of her feetIn darkness, in light,Their sweetness, their heat.We were getting used to her.Miep calls us a handsome pair.
