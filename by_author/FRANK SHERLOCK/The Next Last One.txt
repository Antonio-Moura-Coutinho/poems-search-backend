
One day we’re told to look at the sun
through a hole in a cereal box     All there is to be seen
is the rest of  the world disappearing     This
somehow shadows aliveness but almost
everyone who has ever lived is restlessly sleeping as dead
For who     About what     The end is near over
                    & over yet we insist on making dates to keep talking
          Always about the last eclipse the next blood
          flower buck worm strawberry ice wolf event
          Then there’s a last constellation we might ever see
          until there’s something else to look out for       
Gone are the frightening & gorgeous conspirators
that I’m sure I will not see again    
Traces of sweat & mystery streaks
some hells     communion & of course
a few awkward goodbyes     The mattress is
          gone forever like so many of the bodies I’ve worshipped
Here we are left with impressions
& a recollection of  my side of  the story     I cry
w/ one eye all the time but the right one staid defiant
                                                  What would you read to someone you
                                                  love if you knew that they were dying
If  it’s over again can we share more than black sites &
drownings     skin turned confetti     blue turned coal
& innards swept down sewers w/ brooms
          We give way beyond what we know     So the gun
          in my mouth made me a monster for a while
          Coming back shoeless calloused me
          everywhere but the bottoms of feet     Someone
dressed like a traitor convinced me
there are loyalties that deserve to be broken     Someone
w/ death to the klan on the door
let me know I already broke free
          Hear them both     They’re dead & it’s tricky
          since the decomposed & me are close but here
          I am w/ you     The friend who is you
          Impossible almost lover you     The us
          we chose as family you & others in the fullness of  time
None of us breed but someone will give
birth behind bulletproof glass where life &
the divide begin     This is a fabled event
packaged as betterment     It will spawn someone
who pays to spray us
                                                  like invasive bugs in the street     Cops
                                                  were children so we can look forward to
                                                  good regime/bad regime during future
                                                  questioning     Thanks for the theater
                            but we’ve seen the play     Civil discourse is broken
                            down in the destruction manual     They can have all
                the orchestras     Classical music will never drown out the sins
What would you write to someone you
love if   you thought you might be dying
          Maybe once I was someone who I’d love to see
          punched in the face     But I am here & not yet dead so
          a constellation of the imaginary is no imaginary
          constellation     There is no sky w/o a dream of sky     You
          who are family   fuck a grid & thanks to you I see
          brightness independent of state-­sponsored power
We talk about who threw that brick through
the window     & how it’s now part of a path in a garden
Broken glass is as old as glass     but the sound is
more than fresh wounds     There are fresh worlds still to be heard
                            Oh  & you my friend   I will fight anyone who says
                  you’re not pretty     That is just ridiculous talk     Distant
           impractical you     I believed we could be possible w/ translation
                            software & hearts-for-eyes emojis     No dice
                            but not before I entertained
                            dressing in a tux as your husband     Look
          I never thought when you said no more haircuts
          until wars were over that you’d never have
          short hair again     My beautiful barber
                       brushes my face     I feel funny I
          moan a weird prayer for peace     I guess it could happen
          lol     after all we deserve a new start     Soon we’ll be dead & brag
          about riches     We were here & looked right into the sun
