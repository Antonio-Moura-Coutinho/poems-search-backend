The vet sent blood to the State Police,who sent it to Boston for “further analysis.”Meanwhile, two more died.One so old it was no surprise,and another mistaken for a deer and shot.Some people wanted to make a connection,but the errant hunter was cousin to the sheriffand was known as too dim to pull offa string of horse poisonings.There were no more suspicious deathsin the county for two months. Then three, lying downnext to each other, seen first by my cousin Freddyat dawn in the town square.He delivered newspapers.Horses rarely lie down flatunless they’re sick, or dead.Test results came backfrom Boston and, Freddy said, also the Feds.Inconclusive, though each necropsyshowed that the poisonwas delivered with the aid of a carrotor a sugar cube in a carrot.
