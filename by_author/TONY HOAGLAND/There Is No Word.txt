
There isn’t a word for walking out of the grocery storewith a gallon jug of milk in a plastic sack that should have been bagged in double layers—so that before you are even out the dooryou feel the weight of the jug dragging the bag down, stretching the thinplastic handles longer and longerand you know it’s only a matter of time untilbottom suddenly splits. There is no single, unimpeachable word for that vague sensation of somethingmoving away from youas it exceeds its elastic capacity        —which is too bad, because that is the wordI would like to use to describe standing on the streetchatting with an old friend as the awareness grows in me that he isno longer a friend, but only an acquaintance, a person with whom I never made the effort—until this moment, when as we say goodbye I think we share a feeling of relief,  a recognition that we have reachedthe end of a pretense,   though to tell the truth what I already am thinking aboutis my gratitude for language—how it will stretch just so much and no farther;how there are some holes it will not cover up;how it will move, if not inside, then around the circumference of almost anything—how, over the years, it has given meback all the hours and days, all the plodding love and faith, all themisunderstandings and secretsI have willingly poured into it.
