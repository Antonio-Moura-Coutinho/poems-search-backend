
In her nineties and afraidof weather and of falling ifshe wandered far outside her door,my mother took to strolling inthe house. Around and round she’d go, stalking into corners, backtrack,then turn and speed down hallway, stop almost at doorways, skirt a table, march up to the kitchen sink andwheel to left, then swing intothe bathroom, almost stumble ona carpet there. She must have walkeda hundred miles or more amongher furniture and family pics, mementos of her late husband. Exercising heart and limb,outwalking stroke, attack, she strode, not restless like a lion in zoo,but with a purpose and a gait,and kept her eyes on heaven’s gate.
