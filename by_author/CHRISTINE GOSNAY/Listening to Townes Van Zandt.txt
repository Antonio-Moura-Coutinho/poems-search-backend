
We are of one mindand too much has not been saidabout all the quiet afternoons childhood offered us, lit gray like a cat, or blue, and cursed with an early moon. When father wore an apron or crept like a bear, we screamed.Nothing is so gone. Where is his record player or the channel that forked a distant year toward us,kind, slow magnet?There was a song we sharedwithout your listening, you widowed soul crawling away on your elbows.I sing it to my child, with a full hand Iflick its rapeseeds everywhere,clear, and slow,with all the sincerity its author indeed feltin his ten-gallon hatand his thin, whisky-soaked shirt.
