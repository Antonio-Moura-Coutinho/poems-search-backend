It has manyWounds and historic serial dreams under contract to Hollywood.Who will play the head of Mary, Queen of Scots, and who will braid herHair? Was it she who left her lips on the block for the executioner,Whose hands would never find ablution, who would never touch a womanAgain or eat the flesh of a red animal? Blood pudding would repulse himUntil joining Anne. That is the way of history written for Marlow andShakespear. They are with us now that we are sober and wiser,Not taking the horrors of poetry too seriously. Why am I telling you thisNonsense, when I have never seen you sip your coffee or tea,In the morning? Not to mention,Never heard you sing, although some claim it is quite grand.Will you teach me to sing like Chaliapin? Will I impress you with myCartoon Russian accent? I like sour cream and borsht;We went to school together. My minor was caviar and blinis.This is what it means to listen to Boris Godunov late at night.Cool mornings are for Lakm√© and songs of flowers for misplaced lovers.But why should we speak in a foreign language to each other,We are not birds. I have other stories too strange and beautiful to beTold. They have no sound or memory. They will rest on your lips whenYou bring your hands to your mouth to stop their gush of air against yourFace. We should go back and meet again at the street fair of cufflinks.Our hearts teach us how to fly with wings of pain.That is the price of the disarticulated lessons we should not abstain fromPlaying. The accumulated misdemeanors add up to the most egregiousFelony: ignoring the demands of the heart. We remain in abeyance toThe muses who are only interested in their outcomes,We are just the worms on their hooks of selfishness.What do they care, we are not Greek. We are just a dream of pleasantComic arias that suffice as whims in the morning.We are small enemies to them with strange large hearts that control theWeather in the heavens. They cannot change or unteach us not toTrespass their quarters of endowment. Perhaps, after all, you are anAffable spirit bubbling over with your own deductions to minimize thePointed dots in your beautiful endeavors.Although I feel like a bird with a broken wing,Each day I think of you I fumble an attempt to fly to impress you withThe color of my paper wings.
