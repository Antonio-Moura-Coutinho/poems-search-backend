remind me of the whales
gathering salt for the oceanthis is a poem about my life
you've interrupted
my life and death schedule
which gives me that poetic look each daythis is a poem about my life
where was I before I met you?
I was eroding on my way to work
and slept a lot
deep in the subwaysthis is a poem about my life
then I met your lips
on that windy day
I stopped poisoning my life
on Monday morningsthis is a poem about my life
when I met you
you were undressed
like a stone in the rain
I swam after utterly nakedthis is a poem about my life
before you leave me to heal
I will find you someone to love
who will be shaped like a boxthis is a poem about my life
before you leave me to heal
I will become an apple
and hide in a clockthis is a poem about my life
I will plant these wild lines
they will grow into honey
and weep in the spring
for you
