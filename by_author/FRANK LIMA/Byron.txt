
I put my handInto the dreamThat falls uponThe air. ItTouches me a little,But I don’t complain.I’m almost asleepWhen I get there.Where ByronLost the scent of hisLife, over there,Where the dreams are.It’s alwaysHot, likeThe eyes of theDream. SometimesThe dream isOn the dunesWatching the moltenOcean burn the sun.The dream scours theSand in your fishTank for the plasticMermaid who is gainingweight. Nevertheless,We go to the edgeTo watch the dreamAnd the repetition beingHurled ashore likeA drop of blue,You wrote in a poem,In a languageYou aloneUnderstandIn the dream.
