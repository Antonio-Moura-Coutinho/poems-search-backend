These pillars actually belong to you since I have not counted themOr know any more than you do where they are or in what country theyStill exist. We can put all our concerns into a loaf of bread and FrenchKisses, go to movies and watch the splashing milk on the screen imitatethe forest in the moonlight. Why all the fuss about the patrons becomingFeathers, discharging their ideas of nobility on the evening news? ThereAre no lights in the theater just soft snow from the balcony that is theLittle red schoolhouse where all this began.Actually it was because of you I did not attend as often as I should have.I was too embarrassed to face you across the clay modeling tables since IAlways felt like the clay in your hands was a cartoon version of my teenYears, dear slippery-fish ladies of the sleepy west.Don’t forget, my early life will be yours, too,With its self-descriptions of poetic justice,The tiny creatures we write about can describe themselves in the mossWe leave behind.
