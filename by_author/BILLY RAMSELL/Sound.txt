To render the ocean one needs a whole yearwith Zoom in freezing fingers on a quarter-mile of coast.Sound is the one true vocabulary of natureand not the peacock-palette painters swearhe uses for his best stuff, for his daily disposable frescoes.To render the ocean one needs a whole yearon the quayside tracking the tide’s increasing stature,its drones and climaxes, the diminuendo when it showssound is the one true vocabulary of nature.Nature plays bass clarinet in a Barcelona pop-up theatre.In a polo neck he solos the ocean. He tongues, he blowsto render the ocean. One needs a whole yearor centuries to capture even its least-most feature:like the boat-cove’s lapping, backwashed contraflows.Sound is the one true vocabulary of Nature,who’s lost in his MacBook, applying filter after filterto this day-long rock-pool’s jazz, its stadium of echoes.To render its ocean one needs a whole year:sound is the one true vocabulary of nature.
