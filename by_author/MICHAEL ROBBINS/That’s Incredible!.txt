Be the change you want to see.I’ve legally changed my name to Whites Only.Changed it back, I should say.DO NOT  TRY THIS AT HOME made me the man I am today.That, and the University of  Phoenix.Old man, take a look at my life.Charles Simic, in the gloaming, with a roach,take a look at my life. I’m a lot like you.A man stands up and says I will catcha bullet in my teeth! That’s incredible!He eats a sword, hilt first, and spits up a million people persons.A dolphin pulls an airplane with its blowholeand keeps the black box for itself.Bottleneck dolphins don’t even have bones, yet here we are, giving them medals ...    This is my ass. And that is a holein ground zero. I know which is which.It’s the one with the smoke pouring out.This is my handle; this is my spout.
