
The suite on the sidefacing away from the seais the suite with the fireplaceand two plasma screen tvs.Better luxury compensatesfor lack of view. Beforethe perpetual gas fire, stunnedas if into stone, enteringas you enter your Anne Brontë,a world muted, chemically arranged,I try renewal of a mind remade.Mind is book is water is fire, all change.Fear is the wake-up call at three,too early, for planes. Airport quiet.Leave the hotel without baggage, flydirect to Geneva. They await you there.What occurs is only the turning of a page,imagined for screen. Unseen is greater.Is attested to, as we rise in Mass.Water should be avoided by all thosewho get into difficulty with ease, and cats.Searching for the blackberry in the fur-linedcoat, I roam and ring, openinga closet, from which tumbles a victim,providing a fitting climax. Mrs. Pontifaxis staying across the hall. The glamour.She is the Minister of Finance’s daughter.She sees the cold winter sea rise from her vantage.Our age is blinded by celebrity, seeingwith the gilded orb of a bronze, dull god.The domes of our room service coolafter we have slaked and fed. As you readthis becomes the first one written under the influenceof an anti-depressed self, whatever that is to be.What is, is taken off a shelf, a remaining wrackthat half emerges from the brackish ruins of the year.Will love reunite?Will Ireland be solvent?All nights, holiest, least holy,be still, be silent.  Ireland, Christmas 2009
