
How gloriousis this strange muscle in my mouth.Child’s tease, lips’ balm, baton of speechunless it’s tied.What’s forgotten is on the tip.Sides slip out the truth. The rootis how far a kiss can go.One can lose it when guilty.Be lashed by another’s.Feel it twisting over rooky woods and wordlesshear it swinging in a bell, sliding through a grooveor placed firmly in a cheek. Beware itshould be held most often for most oftena forked one has no friend.
