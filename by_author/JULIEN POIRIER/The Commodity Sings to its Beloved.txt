
I am here
for a very particular reason:
to buy a 6-pack of beer
and berries out of season
 
 
                    all for you, i did it all for you
 
 
I noticed an oil spill
on my drive past the bay,
emergency broadcast on the radio
â€”What do you have to say?
 
 
                    all for you, i did it all for you
 
 
You chopped down the plant
that used to grow my pants,
resurrected it in Indonesia
like a blow-up doll with amnesia
 
 
                    all for you, i did it all for you
 
 
Poor people once lived here
but you flooded the valley
with psilocybin carcinogens,
and forced the kids into shooting galleries
 
 
                    all for you, i did it all for you
