
And yesterday something shattering happened.
Not yesterday, but several (that’s becoming
a favorite word) weeks ago I came across
Kitaj’s The Jewish Rider and wept:
there he was in the very image of my stepfather;
the pate where a few strands of hair still frolic,
the same skinny legs, the same misguided
attempt to dress in a sporty way (who’s
watching?), the same abstractedness,
the same shlumpy—boneless—posture, gazing not
at the landscape flashing past
with wires lashed to the treetops as if with one
tug the countryside would vanish,
or listening to the tick of the rails,
but fixed—distractedly—on his lower extremities,
white loafers and the crease in his pants and nylon
socks to see whether or not he should roll them up … ;
no: looking both beyond and through physical space
into an inner dark. Why else draw the eyes as shadows?
It’s his glimpse into another world.
 
                                                                *
 
My mother’s father hunted and rode.
        My father rode and fished.
My stepfather never budged
        from his Barca Lounger
once the amber liquid began to pour. He had a spiritual life
and a social life and no
        physical life. But he liked it
that I was always outside:
        maybe that’s why he never
got on my back about grades;
        he might have thought
that this boy has to be outside
        at this time in his life. 
Maybe it’s more important
        that he roam the canyons and the hills 
that he know the streets 
        that he come home 
covered with leaves and bark and mud,
        than that he sit there 
like a good young scholar 
        like I was, a Rabbi 
at twenty giving money home
        to my parents in their cabbagy tenement 
in the Bronx. This is a boy
        who needs space. One time—
I think I had my learner's permit—
        he rented a Mustang
convertible in L.A. and for several
        days I drove around
past the long rows of used car lots
        and the bruised facades of restaurants
digging up relatives, my hoarse-voiced
        arthritic aunt in the shadows of
her goldenrod colored ranch house,
        limping like Ruffian
after her last run
        in the wet dirt at Belmont Stakes.
       
                                                                 *
 
But I’ve said nothing about what made me weep.
 
It's in the contrast between Kitaj's alter cocker
seeking comfort on a train,
and Rembrandt’s taut youth
setting off into the rampant amber on horseback;
it’s in the image of active life juxtaposed
with the image of sedentary contemplation—
though no one travels on horseback now
and heroism has become
attending AIDS patients
or sheltering the homeless.
The raw youth’s feet are planted
lightly yet firmly in his stirrups.
His coat glows with many colors.
 
Not so The Jewish Rider.
And yet—there's something more.
 
                                                             *
 
Michael Hoffman writes that New York
is not what it was when I was too young
to have marked the existence of The Blue Note,
but I can pick up this trail
by walking across the park to the Frick.
And Barbara Hershey wouldn’t have been at the Frick in 1959
(they don’t allow children under sixteen)
in black skin tight pants, black sweater,
(the female uniform of our generation
whose male version substitutes
black jeans, baseball hat, and bomber jacket—
though who knows what decorous garments
she’d checked in the cloakroom),
and white boots with plenty
of Elizabethan ruff at the edges,
pausing to look at The Polish Rider
while I scribbled notes. Her white
boots stood out against the dominant dark
like the Jewish Rider’s white loafers.
 
And that was good because the light in the painting is brief
whatever the time of day, sunrise or sunset,
and the rider’s gaze, looking out over
unknown space, is inward.
I followed his eyes through the archway toward canvases
where clouds roll over harbors
against the whiteness of sails
or toward gilded robes and velvet-hung rooms,
then back to meet wisdom’s bared breast
in Veronese’s Wisdom and Strength…
(Why didn’t Veronese have the nerve
to call his painting Woman
With Bare Breasts, like Tintoretto?
Why an allegorical title when the bare
flesh and bones and sinew would have done?)
He spends his life looking not
at far off hills or citadels or
the lights in the village below:
he has no choice but to fix
on her one bared breast, her swelling nipple.
I can’t figure out what landscape
he might be facing in the painted world.
The clatter of rocks and hooves
echoes over the stony plain.
 
                                                                 *
 
I was no rider, but a pretend
horse and rider always rode
beside my train window—at a canter
no matter how fast the rails clicked by—
and though he wore a bandana
and leaned slightly forward in the saddle
to pull himself aboard,
his gaze, wide-ranging yet intent,
was like the Polish Rider’s.
 
Even as an only child I was never lonely.
 
My mother's father rode until he was old
and on a narrow pass his horse
jammed him up against rockface.
In his narrative of his life
this collision marked
the ruin of his hip
the rise of his cataracts.
 
My father rode “every morning before work.”
 
I never witnessed that,
but at a ranch in upper New York State
while I bloodied my hands
tugging the reins of a frothing giant
who would not budge from a weedpatch,
I watched him disappear
in his black polo shirt and khaki jodhpurs
as he galloped over a far off hill:
more at ease in the saddle—in the air—
than I’d ever seen him in civilian life.
 
My woman friend in El Paso lives to ride.
 
Only the Jewish Rider and I do not ride!
 
                                                                  *
 
That’s the stuff of events. What about
the signature inscribed by the sun,
the dark clouds sinister in just being there;
thresholds, exchanges going on in the village below,
candles lit in the deep interiors,
bread, wine, the plate making its way
around the table; what about—
 
leaping centuries ahead—
the energy from generators blazing
like auras through the clouds
the scattered lights,
the rotating tops of ambulances;
the tuna casseroles and macaroni and cheese
 
making the rounds, apple sauce
passing from high chair to bib, the Wonder Bread
on a calcified plate,
children eating, heads down, in silence,
communicating through eye movements,
the mother wiping her lips, the father
grinning stupidly and drooling;
 
the television quacking in the background,
the perfect suburban night unfolding
in bedroom and drive-in and den,
the sprinkler system ticking.
The snipers in the tower—.
This is what the riders,
guests everywhere and nowhere,
 
say goodbye to as their horses break into a canter
as night comes down. And last
night, driving to Connecticut,
I understood that the Polish Rider
gleans the permutations of light after dusk,
that its olive-gray smudges reflect
the absence of pitch-darkness. I was wrong
 
about the Polish Rider all along:
he doesn’t depart at nightfall, he stops for a moment
crossing difficult terrain (anticipating rockslide?)
in the night, because, as the faint light
rimming the edges of the sky makes clear,
night is not absolute black, but rough-hewn and curious.
The rider lives in order to depart.
 
 
                                 The Woman Who Rode
 
She hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house.
Bare trees, frost, the whole bit.
 
I wanted our lives to be like that:
as rife with silences as a Quaker meeting.
 
She came to me in her stride.
Dropped her crop on the chair.
 
Peeled off her britches and boots; crawled
under the covers.
 
Her hour in the saddle had “made her ready.”
I felt like an accessory.
 
The wound was open. Drowsily I rolled
onto her, no longer caring if she
 
was using me. As the new
year wore on and black ice made riding
 
a fast track to certain death
or paralysis, she grew tense.
 
Came to me now with clinical terms,
“schi” words I worked hard to break down.
 
The good news was she was not a true
“split personality”—the glitch
 
that “she was divorced
from herself, and could not love or care.”
 
                                                                  *
 
The light in her house
was like the light before dawn.
 
On the last of my rare visits
her mother jarred preserves while we watched
 
instant replays of Robert Kennedy die and die.
Her father skulked upstairs, perhaps
 
testing gadgets; or wishing me off his daughter;
or taking precautions I would not overhear
 
what words were ricocheting
on his “hot line” to the patent office.
 
                                                                 *
 
Any objective observer standing back
from the distraction of the impinging present
 
could see that her torment overleapt
any visible signs and that she was—
 
as a WASP “rider”—the wrong
person for the place she was in.
 
Her resilience could not be in question.
She lived to stray from known paths
 
to leap stone fences and break into open fields.
When her horse went down in an Irish bog
 
and she was trampled—hooves branding her cheek—
the next day she up and mounted him again.
 
                                                                *
 
When she came to me in the dream last night
her smile had loosened.
 
How lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse.
How well it lit up the colors of her hair.
