
My eyes catch ruddy necksSturdily pressed back.All a red-brick moving glint.Like flaming pendulums, handsSwing across the khaki—Mustard coloured khaki—To the automatic feet.     We husband the ancient gloryIn these bared necks and hands.Not broke is the forge of Mars;But a subtler brain beats ironTo shoe the hoofs of death.Who pays dynamic air now?—Blind fingers loose an iron cloudTo rain immortal darknessOn strong eyes.
