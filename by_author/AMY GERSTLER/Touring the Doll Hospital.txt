
Why so many senseless injuries? This one’s glass teeth
knocked out. Eyes missing, or stuck open or closed.
Limbs torn away. Sawdust dribbles onto the floor
like an hourglass running out. Fingerless hands, noses
chipped or bitten off. Many are bald or burnt. Some,
we learn, are victims of torture or amateur surgery.
Do dolls invite abuse, with their dent-able heads,
those tight little painted-on or stitched-in grins?Hurt me, big botched being, they whine in a dialect
only puritans and the frequently punished can hear.It’s what I was born for. I know my tiny white pantaloons
and sheer underskirts incite violation.
