The friend lives half in the grassand half in the chocolate cake,walks over to your house in the bashful lightof November, or the forceful light of summer.You put your hand on her shoulder,or you put your hand on his shoulder.The friend is indefinite. You are bothso tired, no one ever notices the sleeping bagsinside you and under your eyes when you’re talkingtogether about the glue of this life, the stickysaturation of bodies into darkness. The friend’s crisisof faith about faith is unnerving in its powerto influence belief, not in or toward some otherhigher power, but away from all power in the grassor the lake with your hand on her shoulder, your handon his shoulder. You tell the friend the best thingsyou can imagine, and every single one of them hasalready happened, so you recount themof great necessity with nostalgic, atomic ferocity,and one by one by one until many. The eggbirds whistlethe gargantuan trees. The noiserocks fall twistedinto each other’s dreams, their colorful paratrooping,their skinny dark jeans, little black walnutsto the surface of this earth. You and the friendremain twisted together, thinking your simultaneousand inarticulate thoughts in physical lawlessness,in chemical awkwardness. It is too muchto be so many different things at once. The friendbrings black hole candy to your lips, and jumpingoff the rooftops of your city, the experience.So much confusion — the several layers of exhaustion,and being a friend with your hands in your pockets,and the friend’s hands in your pockets.O bitter black walnuts of this parachuted earth!O gongbirds and appleflocks! The friendputs her hand on your shoulder. The friendputs his hand on your shoulder. You finda higher power when you look.
