One is that some of the girls like cute boys and some
like ugly older men and sometimes women. The differencebetween them is the ones who like older men were felt upby their fathers or uncles or older brothers, or if he didn'ttouch you, still you lived in his cauldron of curses andurges which could be just as worse. They grow already old,angry, and wise, they get rich, get mean, get theirs.The untouched/uncursed others are happy never needing to do much, and never do much more than good. They envytheir mean, rich, talented, drunk sisters. Good girls drink milkand make milk and know they've missed out and know they'rebetter off. They might dance and design but won't rip out lungs for a flag. Bad ones write books and slash red paint on canvas; they've rage to vent, they've fault lines and will rip a toga offa Caesar and stab a goat for the ether. It's as simple as that.Either, deep in the dark of your history, someone showed you that you could be used as a cash machine, as a popcorn popper, as a rocket launch, as a coin-slot jackpot spunker, or they didn't and you grew up unused and clueless. Either you got a clueand spiked lunch or you got zilch but no punch. And you never knew. It's exactly not anyone's fault. If it happened and you don't like older men that's just because you like them so much you won't let yourself have one. If you dideveryone would see. Then they would know what happened a long time ago, with you and with that original him, whose eyes you've been avoiding for decades gone forgotten. That's why you date men smaller than you or not at all. Or maybe you'veturned into a man. It isn't anyone's fault, it is just human and it is what happens. Or doesn't happen. That's that. Any questions? If you see a girl dressed to say No one tells me what to do, you know someone once told her what to do.
