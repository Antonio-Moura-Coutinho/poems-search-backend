
We take more than our share,Several dozen from the star-Flecked cove of a red maplePond, fins tapered like steeples,Gill to gill in the bucketAnd bilge, drawn from a thicketOf drowned rootsInto the nightâ€™s cool garrotes.Sorrowful brothersChoking on strange ethers,Striving, eager, bentToward the sky by want:It was not to be, this breathing,Though not for nothing.
