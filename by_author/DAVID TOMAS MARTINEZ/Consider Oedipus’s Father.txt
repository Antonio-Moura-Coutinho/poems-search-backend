It’s happened to me.                 Get it?Any scenario is better,beats sitting in a car and hearing                 someone you love                 sob,which I have donewith a black eye.For me, a woman’s tearsare IKEA instructionson the European side.I’m sure for Laius, Oedipus’s father, it was the same.                Think of him sleepingafter having held a crying Jocastabecause they had fought for hoursbecause she was stronger.                 Who knew better the anger of young Jocasta?Knew that when the oracle, or the police,                 come, they are taking someone with them.I’m sure Laius looked at the crib                 and thought better youthan me, kid.
