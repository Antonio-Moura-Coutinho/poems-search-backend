
What are my friends? Mouths, not eyes forBitterest underflesh of the farewell.I was a man and suffered like a girl.I spoke underneath to where the lights arePretty, pretty, pretty whence they came to tellOne God gets another. My friends areMouths for God, tearing me. In such a worldBroken only daughter opens to splendor.My first thought was that dying is a deep wellInto the image of death, a many of one girl.Later it meant to smile with no face, whereMirrors are mouths. Cupid and Psyche woreBlindfolds made of glass, which explains why girlsGet to heaven early mornings Adam fell.Gods after gods we go. Still later,Friends shouldered high mountains to the lee shore.Gashed, and the gash a fountain of waters,The landscape defames a single flower:Amaranth. Magic hides an island worldOf boys and one daughter. I buried a pearlIn God’s eye. And yet He sees her,Defames her, considers His time wellSpent imagining a continent of flowersWhose final climate is a broken girl.Bells of a Cretan woman in laborHurled from a tower, flesh realerThan the ground she somehow upwards curledInto the bloom of her groin where bellsAre bees. I am an old man with a new beard.I am the offspring of my child sprung from hell.Shipwreck makes peninsular metaphorOut of my hatred, her rape, and one bell tower.Confusion suicides the poems, heaven I heardWhere the juice runs from stone-struck flowers.At the end of the world I must use properViolence. Nothing is more true to tell.Tell the taut-strung higher calendarsI’ve a margent in mind and new wordsHope to say, catastrophe to hear, Old confederates and inwood applesWhere apples never shone. Also tellOf mountains shouldered underneath one flowerCalled amaranth. They tired of the worldWho made the world this way. God neverDid, never will. If you were to callFrom the bottom of the ocean, the words,Every one to me a living daughter,Would shout wild mercy as never was before.
