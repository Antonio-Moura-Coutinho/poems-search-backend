I Gray sky, gray sea — gray mind, the man thinks. He thinks:To grow old with it and kicks a stone into the water.He mucks at the seam and it crumbles below him.A sea gull beaks a crab, flights vertically and dropsit to the rocks. The man cracks with laughter,tossing a stone to a stone.II Working alone means the voice must grow louder,for who can stand to think quietly all through the day’s calculations?I cannot. I let the voice grow loud. I let the voicehum outside my body in distinguishable phrasings, and countthe increments as I set the fence according to the blade. All dayI stand before a blade and push things into its path.I stand aside as what is removed is whisked alongside me.The smallest particles of   what is removed thicken the air,making a dream inside which one cannot live. All daythe voice is learning how to be outside of   the body.III A man is not a beach, nor is he stone, though he collects their entiretyin a single thought. He works alone and his thoughts begin tosmack of stone. His teeth clatter with their collection.IV A man can hold a secret between his teeth,and it will never leave his mouth, for who would listento his wavering tune of so sad and how hard and hearanything original? He is that he is — the errand and the foolrunning to himself over and over only to find that even heis tired of telling about it. To grow old with itwas the task, and the question always: would he last?A man can believe in the body and have no one,as though he were ghostor stone, nothing to speak at or be heard from.V All work, no pay makes a body bray.Though he may bray —Though he may bray and bray,forgive him the bit. If he tells you his secret,he will have no secret.This is how one sings a sentence into stone.
