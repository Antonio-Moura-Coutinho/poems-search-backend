The whole room swellswith the scent of cinnamon & desire.How imprecise the smell of desire.The wood takes on a sheen, a glossthe grain can live behind without worryof  being forgotten. A single knot blinksout of the small block and becomesthe eye of a hummingbird, its beakbending around the edge of the wood,its small song captured in the annular rings. To think, this block was tossed inwith the scraps. That the birdcould have been lost. Or burned.
