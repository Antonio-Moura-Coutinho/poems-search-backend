I’d commit the sceneto black and white if I could, the sky brightand bottomless, trees gnarled as the knees of elephants.Helpless in his Biltrite pram, Ansel Adams is watchingthe clouds roll in. Then the clouds would gather speed,roll out again, and the camera pan down to Ansel Adamsthe man kneeling on granite, choosing one filterover another. It’s as though more and greater apparatuswere needed to recapture that first exposure, saysthe voice-over: as though Ansel Adams were a pioneertoiling after the spirit, not just the body, of America.To tiny Ansel Adams, newly arrived on this earth,the sky must seem a matter of fact. It’s the mindbeneath he wants to grasp, stowed in its smart blackenclosure. I’d have his pram gather speed and transform,a cartoon robot against the heavens, wheels spinning,into Ansel Adams’ camera. Now the bright black skyis Ansel Adams and Ansel Adams the filter;light renders each tree a bouquet of paper;the Great Depression gathers like so much weather.To tiny Ansel Adams, newly arrived on this earth,the sky is what it is, taut with its isness.Some time before dawn, the section framedby interior blackens and brightens and each tree out thereglows with itself, with the certainty of all Ansel Adams’aspens. No one is watching but this one bewilderedimmigrant, toiling after sleep, saturated in monochrome.Sometimes it’s all you’ll find in the wilderness: AnselAdams, tiny in his pram, composing the day just gone.
