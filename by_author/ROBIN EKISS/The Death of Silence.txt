(Long live silence.)Let’s observe a moment of it, call it what it’s not: splatter of rain that can’t soothethe window’s pane, dog barking up the wrong tree. Which tree, which air apparent is there to hear a word at its worth? Hammer that drums its water-logged warning against the side of the submarine: I’m buried to the hiltlike the knife, after it’s thrown, continues to bowto the appleit’s split.
