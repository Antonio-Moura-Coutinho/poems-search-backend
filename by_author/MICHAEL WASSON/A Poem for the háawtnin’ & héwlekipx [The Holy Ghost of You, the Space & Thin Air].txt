Had this body been madeof nothing
but its bright skeleton & autumn-
blown skinI would shut my eyes
into butterfly wingson a mapped earth. Had the gods
even their own gods, I could re-
learn the very shapeof my face in a puddle of sky-
colored rain. Extinction isto the hands
as the lips areto the first gesture
the tongue carves into the slick mouth
just beforeprayer. In every way
the world failsto light the soft inner
machine & marrowof the bones in motion — I imagine
smudging my tongue along a walllike the chest
I dare to plunge in-to, the Braille of every node
blooming outas if the first day-
light of winteredsnowfall. This night — 
like any fleshed boy I dreamof a lyre strung
with the torn hair of hímiin &in place
of my dried mouth — thereit is. Whispers
in the blue-black dark after c’álalalc’álalal reach outtoward my teeth to strum
this wilting instrument. &once awake, I’m holding
its frame to builda window back in-
to the world. Had this body
been held after allthese years, I would enter
you to find my frozen self
& touch. Like the gutted animalwe take
in offering. & live.
