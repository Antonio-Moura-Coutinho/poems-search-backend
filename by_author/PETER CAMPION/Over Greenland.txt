Waking upto ice cubes cracking in a plastic cupand voices (“awesome for the Hong Kong branch. . . well, most of all we miss our daughter . . . ”) I stillsee it: the climb up slate as runnels spillfrom some bare misted summit like a source.Whatever sense this dream might maketo others. And whatever when they wakethey also have been dreaming. Rivers of facesdown hallways, merging, as desires meshand fissure. Cash for clothes or arms or flesh.And if there is no towering sublimewhere all comes clear to all, no final climbthrough cloud, like some old Bible illustration:how could that ever stop the current flowingout of the glass at jfk: skin glowingplumb and peach as we walk inside the sun.
