How can I tell you                                           O my soul, To exhaust the realm of the possible when                                  Ever the lightIs uncongenial as February and your hand unlovely?Like a dog nearly annihilated by nervesAnd boredom chewing her paw to sore, red velvet,You’ve torn your nails so far ﬂesh swellsClosed around each bed like an eyeless socket.That you should be making such small change!Fingers inarticulate as moles nudge a debris Of dimes not thick enough to hide The candy-colored butterﬂy ﬂaringAcross the tender, veined delta of your handHeralding indelibly the eviction                            Of this vulgar ﬂeshOr the one word needled in black, knuckle-Gothic
