Just one more vintage movie,Batwings tonight at the Bal Masqué — Another creature stuffedBy distinguished pedigree.I get a lot of madcap ideas about sentience,How knowing has you put down in the book Forbidden speech recognition — Else why make such a face?And now it’s luck no longer mouth that movesWhen fastidious rummage whispersTo divulge a surplusA clue if not the key.Prospect my question laps up for good — I lean to it. Knowing you,First-person dwindle.Tweet-tweet. Prick.
