His older sisterdid what she could to train the bitten sealof   his brain to twirl the red ball on the nose of eloquence, and his grandmothertired of   insisting he utter the namesof   toys or foods — for every desirewas coded — and gave him whateverhe grunted and pointed to. O, the man then a boythought, when I tower among themI should invent my own speechand leave others empty and afraidthat they did not know it, could not askor plead their case in the one tonguethat mattered. I shall have themlook upon the simplest things,the man then a boy thought, and fill up with stolen awe,and point with their faces,their pupils wide as blackened coins,and hope with all the revenueshattered heart-glass can musterthat someone had graspedtheir need as need and notas the monstrous couplingof   sounds in a trance of whims.Then, the grind of   his teethvowed, then the plazas of my citywill fill with my name,and their blood will matter as little to them as to me.
