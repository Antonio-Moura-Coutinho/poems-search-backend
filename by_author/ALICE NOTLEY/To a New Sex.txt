I got it — The rest of the language, beauty and playI am your master, the thought says —        I disagreeI’m thinking about the church where weheld my brother’s funeral. He says, I was there:it hurt me; you cried too much; I don’t mindlater. I just want to be with you, the thought saysYou mean thee thought or his thought?The rocks are like stars, gully full of stars.If I go with anyone anywhere, if they’dthink sweetly to me. No one hears. Relax your shoulders.I’m singing to you over and over “to a new sex.”Sometimes it seems like there’s a lizard for each rocknecklaces of lives,
   there’s room for an infinity of minds. Thoughts. Anywhere. Enter my headif you wish. No ends or purposesPrevailed fortunes. I have a destiny. My deathwill not complete it.
