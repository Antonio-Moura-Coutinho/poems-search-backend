
Two men share
one tooth. From
one tooth the men
predict the world.
Thank you! or
we would not exist.
Two men and one
tooth is not a problem.
One man is wide
and one man is sober.
Sometimes the men are
the same. Little tooth
is the light of the
orchard. From
it all things are
made up. Once
the two men lost
the tooth and every
one disappeared.
No one was angry
because no one was
there. The men
found the tooth
when the tooth
started laughing.
The men said what
is that noise and
the world came
back on. They told
the tooth thatâ€™s not
funny but it was
very funny. One
man swallowed
the tooth and put
on all the sad
knowledge.
He wanted to
punish the tooth
but the tooth
punished him. It
lasted three hours
and then he threw
up. The two men
live in a cave with
bay windows. To
be in love is so
solemn think the
two men once
a year. The tooth
never thinks any
thing. It is the
tooth of a goat.
