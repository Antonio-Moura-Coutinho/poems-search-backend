i
how much     loss
gains suddenly in emphasis
and     brilliant sadness
  iifar from that which lives and turns
  iii
languages
of our vain comings and goings wilt and gnaw
  ivbeat them,                                punish
them for having said and always said
  v
tear out, finally,      our spells
  vione life pours and grows impatient
for another life
  vii
and the lovers, look on them there,
immobile and frail
pinned like the butterflies
for the beauty of their wings
  viiitoo great in the outdoors
  ixlike the lyre, you should be
rendered a constellation
