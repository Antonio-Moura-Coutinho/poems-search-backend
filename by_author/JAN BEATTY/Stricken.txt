
We’re sitting in Uncle Sam’s Subs, splitting
a cheesesteak, when Shelley says:I think I should buy a gun.
I look up at her puffy face, and she’s staring,
her hands shaking. On medication for
schizophrenia, she’s serious.
I say, Tell me why you need a gun.
Her voice getting louder: You know why.No, no I don’t, I say.In case I need it. I might need it to shoot somebody.
I give her a hard look — You don’t need a gun.
No one is after you.
