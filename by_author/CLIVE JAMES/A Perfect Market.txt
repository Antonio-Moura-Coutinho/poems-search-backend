Recite your lines aloud, Ronsard advised,Or, even better, sing them. Common speechHeld all the rhythmic measures that he prizedIn poetry. He had much more to teach,But first he taught that. Several poets paidHim heed. The odd one even made the grade,Building a pretty castle on the beach.But on the whole it’s useless to point outThat making the thing musical is partOf pinning down what you are on about.The voice leads to the craft, the craft to art:All this is patent to the gifted fewWho know, before they can, what they must doTo make the mind a spokesman for the heart.As for the million others, they are blessed:This is their age. Their slapdash in demandFrom all who would take fright were thought expressedIn ways that showed a hint of being planned,They may say anything, in any way.Why not? Why shouldn’t they? Why wouldn’t they?Nothing to study, nothing to understand.And yet it could be that their flight from rhymeAnd reason is a technically preciseResponse to the confusion of a timeWhen nothing, said once, merits hearing twice.It isn’t that their deafness fails to matchThe chaos. It’s the only thing they catch.No form, no pattern. Just the rolling diceOf idle talk. Always a blight before,It finds a place today, fulfills a need:As those who cannot write increase the storeOf verses fit for those who cannot read,For those who can do both the field is clearTo meet and trade their wares, the only fearThat mutual benefit might look like greed.It isn’t, though. It’s just the interchangeOf showpiece and attention that has beenThere since the cavemen took pains to arrangePictures of deer and bison to be seen To best advantage in the flickering light.Our luck is to sell tickets on the nightOnly to those who might know what we mean,And they are drawn to us by love of sound.In the first instance, it is how we singThat brings them in. No mystery more profoundThan how a melody soars from a stringOf syllables, and yet this much we know:Ronsard was right to emphasize it so,Even in his day. Now, it’s everything:The language falls apart before our eyes,But what it once was echoes in our earsAs poetry, whose gathered force defiesEven the drift of our declining years.A single lilting line, a single turnOf phrase: these always proved, at last we learn,Life cries for joy though it must end in tears.
