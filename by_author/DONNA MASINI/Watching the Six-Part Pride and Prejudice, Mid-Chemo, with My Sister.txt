
We start stopping when she’s afraid
something bad will happen. Don’t worry,
I say, all will be well.
 
How could she know? She’s never
read it, never heard of Elizabeth
and Jane, never wanted Mr. Darcy. Like me
 
she needs to know how things will end.
I know Elizabeth will be fine. As I knew,
last week, my sister weeping, that Elinor–
 
sobbing, begging–wouldn’t lose Marianne.
It’s Jane Austen! My sister doesn’t know that
in Austen nothing really bad happens. I leave her
 
on the couch with the last hours.
How much my sister will have to endure,
alone, with this new drama.
 
Later her message. The last one
in which she will sound like herself.Hi, it’s me. The movie was unbelievable. 
 Unbelievable.
