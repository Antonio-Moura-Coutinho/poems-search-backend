Falling for herberry lightness they slip outfrom their outlines. One guy saysshe takes the form of a dream,or the dream of a form.On the page of the regionalnight berriespulse like the notes of a songin the stream. The girlwho sheds the skin of her longingescapes into morelonging.In a dream on the marginsof town one of the guyshears a girl sing, her voicelike strings,a basket of ripe berriesfloating into the nighton a stream.The girl, the guy, in derelictbedrooms hear lucent songsundressing,streaming from their outlinesthrough the boundariesof town wrapping around themthe scent of fresh berries.And I was the guy and the girlwas withinthe page of the townever, over, after, never, the songlong, long, long, long.The stream is slipped as the groundyou stand on.Build houses out of song.The berries are undressing.The stream is long, gone, long.The girl dreams a form of dream,or forms a dream of form:the boundaries of song in the nightundressed as a stream in the morning.
