I tryto make my toddler son laugh by hoppingfrom one button to the next, watching each lobelight up along the way, but he will not leave the prisonof his melancholy. My son: how he loves to revisitthe most difficult point of conflict in a picture book,or the moment at which his favorite car heavesa difficult sigh at the pinnacle of a movie’s emotionalarc, or the promise of injury if I take a fall. My son,so distant from other children in his sadness.Just the other day, at the pool, he gazedat the boys and girls splashing and shriekingand said, Look. The children are having fun,as if he were an anthropologist in a foreign land.If these are his musings at age two, one can onlyimagine the life that must follow. Through a dark channelhe was born; to darkness he is most drawn. Easierto write than say the guilt I feel for giving himthe sharp pain of melancholy. My son, alwaysin the world without husk or shell, it is as if his heartthrobs on the outside of his body, as if his brainhas no skull to absorb the assaults that strike it.Today, I watch him writhe in the pain of a tantrum —a typical kid, this is what they do, everyone assures me — and usually I rush in, unwittingly increasinghis sense of emergency. Instead, today, I stand back,relinquish the role of skull and skin, watch his mindunfurl like a medieval tapestry. In that momentof my feigned disinterest, his head is no longer headbut battlefield where Wrath wages a fierce waragainst Patience. He is no longer a little boyscreaming on the ground and throwing plastic trucks;instead he is a creature engaged in a struggleto free his enslaved heart from the monsterswhose foaming mouths and hot fumesand clots of foul blood besiege himas he gathers his thoughts from the unraveling of his universe. Prudentius says that fiery Wrathin her frenzy slays herself and diesby her own weapons
