Cross-hatchings, palm and rain,
clapboard faded
to the grain, half-shutters
open to old vines and mangroves
draining their own shadows;
recollecting what the body knows
suspended between coral
and shifting images of cloud ...
After death,
after the knowledge
of death,his death,
his face, unwrapped,
already yellowed,
papery, recovered
with a small white cloth
then lowered away
and shut to the earth;
So pierced,
so mute,
these words
re-opening: Not this.
2.
The rain had gone. I swam against the current,
harnessed by water till I turned and swung
out with the tide, shouldering deep
into a rhythm of my own, long strokes
pulled under the body and returning
past the glinting crease in which I breathed,
the sea half-woken like another body
bedded into sheer transparency,
the outer reaches granular with light.
Comebacks. Chains of radiance.
Far more than meet the eye.
What do they meet then, intimate
but otherworldly, mimicking the world?
I looked back at the landâ€™s thin edge,
pines along the shoreline near a fort
where cannons rust, mouths left open among
thistleweed around the dozing moat.
Far back among fallen needles, pigeons shuffle
through shade, their feathers iris underlight,
soft flares bob the dark.
The land had disappeared.
The sun had followed it. From either wrist,
half-mingled with my breath into the night,
a trail of ungloved phosphor travelled back.
3.
Sounds too have their surfaces:within
the mortal frame, particles of blood
revolve as in a sort of heaven where
breath moves through us as an unseen light;
but when the marrow bonds are parted they in turn
set loose what has been called the soul ...
