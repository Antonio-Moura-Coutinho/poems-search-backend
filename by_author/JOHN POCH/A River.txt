But the trophies:a goldfinch tearing up a pink thistle,a magpie dipping her wing tipsin a white cloud, an ouzel barreling hip-high upstream with a warning.You wish you had a river. To makea river, it takes some mountains.Some rain to watershed. You wishyou had a steady meadow and pink thistlesbobbing at the border for your horizons,pale robins bouncing their good posturesin the spruce shadows. Instead, the lawof life comes for you like three men and a car. In your dreams, you win them overwith your dreams: a goldfinch tearing up a pink thistle. A magpie so slow she knows how to keep death at bay, she takes her time with argument and hides her royal blue in black. Shy as a blue grouse, nevertheless Goddoesnâ€™t forget his green mountains.You wish you had a river.
