Some even sow the dry playamid-summer with sorghum, the cotton plowed underafter early hail. Thus, not every farmer keepsan old broken homestead sacred as a graveyard. Today, no Sharpshin on a pivot for an omen,no stoic farmer on a turn-row changing water.Among a little wind grit, in a grid on a grid, somewhere like the crossroads of outer space and Earth, Texas, a handful of ragged elms withstand a long swayof heat and wind. These old guards of a home haunt the field but wither even as ghosts must. Honor themwith a walk among homesick bricks, and prophesy good.
