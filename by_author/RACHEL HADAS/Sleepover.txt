
Ida and Isidor Straus sleep side by sideeternally in an Egyptian galleyfronting their Woodlawn mausoleum.Symbolically they lie. Their boat is small;nor was her body recovered from the Titanic.And yet the image of the voyage holds.Why not embark? A river runs behind meon the other side of this dark window.A dream called Night Boatarranged us side by side in a black craft,sailing the river of forgetfulnessuntil the stars went out.It was poetic license. I didnâ€™t dream that boat.The boat was dream, and we were passengersbalanced on the slippery cusp of daylight,unless you had already disembarkedin some shadowy port,leaving me to sail along alone.
