
How many miles to the borderwhere all the sky there isexists for the soul alone?Where the only breathersbreathing are constructedfrom some new electricityand the flowers are madeindestructible, and messagesfrom the dead arrive like calmwhite birds with a gift?One more night of spiritualice and we might all becomebirds, green birds frozen on a black winter branch.There is a drumming in the shadowsunder leaves: a million eight-eyedspiders on the march.The buckeyes beat themselves half to death against some lit-from-within screen.
