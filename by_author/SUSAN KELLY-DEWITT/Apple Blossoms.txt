
One evening in winter when nothing has been enough, when the days are too short,the nights too long and cheerless, the secret and docile buds of the appleblossoms begin their quick ascent to light. Night after interminable nightthe sugars pucker and swell into green slips, green silks. And just as you findyourself at the end of winterâ€™s long, cold rope, the blossoms openlike pink thimbles and that black dollop of shine calledbumblebee stumbles in.
