That need,that scared need to whitenor clean a surface: plywood or lawn,and the spywall behind which I stood,stock-still, and sinned againstthe fly’s flyness. Though you liveinside me, though you laid eggsin the moisture at the cornersof my eyes, I still dream aboutyour sinking empire twenty feet abovesea level, and the many thingsyou never see: beautiful bleachedgas can, tomato posts bent into art,
