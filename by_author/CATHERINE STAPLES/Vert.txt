
As in green, vert, a royal demesnestocked with deer. Invert as in tippedas a snow globe, going nowhere in circlesbut not lost, not bereft as the woodwithout deer, waiting for the white antleredbuck, or his does, or any slim yearlingto step along the berm, return. Vertigoas in whirling round, swimming in the head,unanchored by the long spring,the horse cantering, the meadow droppinglike an elevator into the earth, fallinglike Persephone through a crevice, a swivelingcrack, a loose screw, a lost way. Disorderedas in death lasts, my brother’s not coming back.The spin of it continuous as in looking downfrom height, and then it stops, the spinningjust slows, a chariot wheel stilled in grass.The world is the same, but it isn’t. The tippedviews of trees when hanging from your knees.The deer in twos and threes watching.
