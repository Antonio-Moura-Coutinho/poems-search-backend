
Our loneliness sits with us at dinner, an unwanted guest who never says anything. It’s uncomfortable. Stillwe get to know each other, like students allowed to use a private research library for only one night.I go through her file of friends, cities and jobs. “What was that like?” I ask. “What did you do then?”We are each doctors who have only ourselves for medicine, and long to prescribe it for what ailsthe other. She has a nice smile. Maybe, maybe . . . I tell myself. But my heart is a cynical hermitwho frowns once, then shuts the door of his room and starts reading a book. All I can do now is wantto want her. Our polite conversation coasts like a car running on fumes, and then rolls to a stop;we split the bill, and that third guest at the table goes home with each of us, to talk and talk.
