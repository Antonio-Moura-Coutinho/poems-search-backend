We listento music for hours and dance aroundthe house like crazy skeletons: loosewith all our bones knocking, we go,“click click click” and wave our armsand shake until we rattle all the chinain mom’s cabinet. He turns the volumeup and we spin like planets round the sun.Babe says he’s no fun but I know differentbecause I see him laughing and I try,which she just never does. She walksinto the house with Jasper waiting in the car.She grabs some clothes or asks for money,though she doesn’t even come to do thatanymore. They don’t even talk. Last timewe had the music on loud and we were dancing.I was letting my head swing back and forthand she just stood and watched us with the strangestlook and I said, “I’m Shakey Eyes! Come dance,”and moved my arms around. I followed her upthe stairs, swinging like a satellite and going,“Ooh ooh ooooohhhhh,” just like a low-down good-for-nothing so and so. I know she thinks I’m funnybut she didn’t laugh and I said, “Come dance!You know you’ve got the blues.” Then I said, “You’reno fun.” She said, “You don’t know him like I do.”
