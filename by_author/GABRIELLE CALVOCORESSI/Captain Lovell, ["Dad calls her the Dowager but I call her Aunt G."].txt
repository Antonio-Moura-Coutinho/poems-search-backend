
Dad calls her the Dowager but I call her Aunt G.Aunt G. at the Polo Lounge. Aunt G. drinking gimletsby the pool. Aunt G. asking about Babe eventhough she’s the only one who sees her that muchanymore. She wears ten rings. Seven on herright hand, which Dad calls the Seven Stars.They make the glass seem like it’s going to crack.She doesn’t like me very much. I know it.I’m not her kind of girl. I won’t wear dressesand when she placed the ring inside my handI just said, “No, thank you.” Not even thinkinghow rude that might sound. What would I dowith a ring like that? I’ve got my own starsand she doesn’t really want to giveme presents anyway. She gave Babe a car,her dark brown Aston Martin. And she gaveDavid a watch to “remember home by.”She gave my Dad a look when he said, “David’sa good soldier.” Like he gave her something badto eat. She just shook her head and said,“I’ll never understand what kind of man you are.”And then she said Dad would have that young boy’sblood on his hands. Which I don’t understand.Or why she said, “You’ve gone and lost the bothof them. You’re your very own Pol Pot,” while lookingthrough her purse. It shone so bright it blindedme. For a second I saw spots and couldn’t focuson the thing. One clear stone that caught the lightand made reflections on my glasses. I didn’t wantit. I don’t wear things like that. “Who are you?”she asked, not in a mean way but like she trulydidn’t know. And didn’t really care. She took it backand asked me if  I’d talked to Babe and I saidI had not and no one else had either.I said, “She’s living in the hills.”And she looked at the ring for a minuteand put it back in her purse.
