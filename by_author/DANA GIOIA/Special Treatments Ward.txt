Or bald and pale,they lie in bright pajamas on their beds,watching another world on a screen.The mothers spend their nights inside the ward,sleeping on chairs that fold out into beds,too small to lie in comfort. Soon they slipbeside their children, as if they might meshthose small bruised bodies back into their flesh.Instinctively they feel that love so strongprotects a child. Each morning proves them wrong.No one chooses to be here. We play the partsthat we are given—horrible as they are.We try to play them well, whatever that means.We need to talk, though talking breaks our hearts.The doctors come and go like oracles,their manner cool, omniscient, and oblique.There is a word that no one ever speaks.
