With secret despairI returned to the city. Something seemed to be waiting for me. Maybe the “chosen guide” Wordsworth wrote he would even were it “nothing better than a wandering cloud”have followed which of course to meand everyone sounds amazing.All I follow is my own desire, sometimes to feel, sometimes to beat least a little more than intermittentlyat ease with being loved. I am neverat ease. Not with hours I can read or walkand look at the brightly coloredhouses filled with lives, not with nightwhen I lie on my back and listen,not with the hallway, definitely not with baseball, definitely not with time. Poor Coleridge, sonof a Vicar and a lake, he could not feelthe energy. No present joy, no cheerfulconfidence, just love of friends and the windtaking his arrow away. Come to the edgethe edge beckoned softly. Takethis cup full of darkness and stay as longas you want and maybe a little longer.
