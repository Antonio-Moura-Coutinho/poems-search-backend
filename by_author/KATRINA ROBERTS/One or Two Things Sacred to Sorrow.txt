
Coleman Hawkins doing that thing
with his sax: high
and lonely as a kestrel
twirls on thermals, sorting
files of sound with a singular
finger, now alighting 
in pools of light, hovering
then fixed like whirring
wings of the insect glazed
in serous amber but
dreaming of oxygen:
Sound leading a mindinto that sobrietyof thought which poisesthe heart. Sound like that,
holding and giving out
never. Sound quickenedwith desire. Soundthe benefit of nature
in taut bolts of time, rich
polychrome threads, count:
Two-sixty. Sound blots outthe violence of affliction
bringing it home lonely
but good, letting
it bend: Wehad much more reason being
winged ones to recollect than forget.
