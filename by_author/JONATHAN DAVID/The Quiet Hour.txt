
When the hour is hushed and you lie still,So quiet is the room about meIt seems perhaps that you are gone,Sunken to a marble sleep.I hear no sound; my quiet will,Passive as the lambs at rest,Stirs not the quaint forgetfulnessBut only murmurs, “Sleep is strange!”The low moon at the lattice goingRests no more quietly than you at peace.Hushed is the candle; the hour is late,And I, poor witness of extreme change,I think perhaps then heaven opensLike the unfolding of your hand in sleep—Your cold white hand—to close again—While I sit staring at the marble gate.
