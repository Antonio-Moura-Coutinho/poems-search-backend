This is the deathless body, and this
the land’s blood … and here the wine-laced sky
over Iowa resembles a heavenly parfait.
In one more day Des Moines
will be diapered by first snow. A young girl,
barely real, glazes the sidewalk
with a stupid look. Iowa in winter always
dumbfounds the love in us.
Before long, nothing opposes the weight and resolution
of this sky, this wilderness of earth
hardening. When heaviness strikes like a clock
glowing incandescently, the season
opens to itself, as if a familiar stunt
in a traveling show, a fabulation only
a touched young girl can devise for any new world.
