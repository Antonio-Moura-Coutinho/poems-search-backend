
Though half my years besiege the aged sun,     I have not lived. My robust preparation     Lags tardily behind fit consummation,Droops sweatily in courses just begun.Oh, I have loved and lusted with the best,     Plucked momentary music from the senses;     I’ve kissed a lip or two with fair pretensesAnd wept for softness of a woman’s breast.My mind rebounds to nether joys and pain,     Toying with filth and pharisaic leaven;     I know the lift up sundry peaks to heaven,And every rockless path to hell again.I wait the hour when gods have more to giveThan husks and bare insatiate will to live.
