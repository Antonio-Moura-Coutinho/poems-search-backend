It.You know what I mean. The lower halfaglitter, the top half brainy as beautifulis sometimes, murderous lovelies, their plottingand resolve and why notget these guys good, the lechers.To see at all in the whirling, to hearwhat anyone mightin wind roar and faint whistle — don’t worry about girls shrewdas whimsy, legend-toughto the core. Don’t. But it’stheir spell too, isn’t it? Locked there.Aligned with singing, dazzlerazor-blackened green. Not that theymiss what human is like or know any endto waters half born to, from wherethey look up.Men in boats, so sick of the journey.Men gone stupid with blue,with vast, with gazing over and awaythe whole time until same to same-old tonow they’re mean. After that, small.Out there, the expanse. In here,the expanse. The men look down. Achingmisalignment — gorgeouslure that hides its hook steely sweetto o my god, little fool’s breathtriumphant, all the way under and am Inot deserving?
