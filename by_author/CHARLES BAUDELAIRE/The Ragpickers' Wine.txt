
In the muddy maze of some old neighborhood,Often, where the street lamp gleams like blood,As the wind whips the flame, rattles the glass,Where human beings ferment in a stormy mass,One sees a ragpicker knocking against the walls,Paying no heed to the spies of the cops, his thralls,But stumbling like a poet lost in dreams;He pours his heart out in stupendous schemes.He takes great oaths and dictates sublime laws,Casts down the wicked, aids the victims' cause;Beneath the sky, like a vast canopy,He is drunken of his splendid qualities.Yes, these people, plagued by household cares,Bruised by hard work, tormented by their years,Each bent double by the junk he carries,The jumbled vomit of enormous Paris,â€”They come back, perfumed with the smell of staleWine-barrels, followed by old comrades, paleFrom war, mustaches like limp flags, to marchWith banners, flowers, through the triumphal archErected for them, by some magic touch!And in the dazzling, deafening debauchOf bugles, sunlight, of huzzas and drum,Bring glory to the love-drunk folks at home!Even so, wine pours its gold to frivolousHumanity, a shining Pactolus;Then through man's throat of high exploits it singsAnd by its gifts reigns like authentic kings.To lull these wretches' sloth and drown the hateOf all who mutely die, compassionate,God has created sleep's oblivion;Man added Wine, divine child of the Sun.
