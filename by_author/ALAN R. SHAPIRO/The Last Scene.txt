
Extravagant sweep
                         of clear sky
                                           darkening
in the big picture window
                                     beside the bed,
lights here and there
                               already flashing all
across the city down below us—
                                              Ellen
and the girls out somewhere,
                                          you and I alone,
you with your eyes closed,
                                       I with a drink in hand:
you suddenly in character,
                                        your voice
a wraith’s voice,
                         faint, stumbling,
                                                   slurry
with morphine,
                     and yet
                               still artful
                                                 as ever,
even if the art
                      was obvious,
the dying brother
                      playing the dying brother—Do you think
                  you have a problem
                                             with that?
