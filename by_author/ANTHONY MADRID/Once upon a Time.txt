That provocative way of standing!All elbows and banglesAnd hips just like a coat hangerAnd ankles at right angles! I like The shape of the pouring soy milk,The sound of the splitting log.But Egret finds it regrettable that herSister is dating a dog.Don’t listen to ’em, kid!And don’t listen to their questions.This corporation’s been ruined byWell-meaning false confessions.And the world is fast a-melting,Though I would have it slow.And I don’t think it’s helping:The way these animals goStraight from hatchery to quackery,And, if only to amuse,I’ll throw my hat in with Mike Thataway inBlack patent leather shoes.Maybe I’m just like my mother.She’s never satisfied.Maybe I’m just like my father:Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.Maybe I’m just like my cat:Licking invisible balls.Perhaps you’ll reflect upon that, Next time you’re screening your calls.And all the solvent and the solute,They were walking hand in hand.This the Indian poets were theFirst to understand.The ancient Indian poetsHad their heads screwed on straight.Fixed on the body’s affluenceAnd the effluents that escape.And the influence they enjoyed?Close-focus hocus-pocus.And every gezunte moydIn a juvenile honey locustWill prefer their Hindi distichsTo the Indiana Hoosiers.We’re gonna be there from Spit ChristmasAll the way to Mucus New Year’s.But for now I draw the curtainAnd settle into Lent.Last person to go to HarvardWithout knowing what that meant.
