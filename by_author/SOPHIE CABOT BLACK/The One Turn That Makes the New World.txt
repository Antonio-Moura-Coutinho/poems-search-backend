The animal I brought Into this no longer mine, the taskEach day was to confine enough, from harmOr from each other as night loosensOver the assemblage. But in the pastureOne wrong step was taken. And those who remainAre weary, heads low, torment nowhere   To be seen, not even in the illuminationOf men who have come to help,Who behind the double doors keep watchBy the body so it does not becomeAnything for those who scavenge, to follow backThe acts of blood right up to the locked stall And light where each shaft lands precisely again Through the again. The horse was in the snow,The rock was underfoot; all the unknowablesMade whole and apparent by one who stumbled.
