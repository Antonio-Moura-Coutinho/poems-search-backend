The man or woman Off down the valley or working aboveTreeline. No other sound but a few strays Hurrying through the dusk as if the endWill begin, certain and with nothingMore to say. She does not know she does not know. Having come back to find her kindAnd none being left she took herself up Into a tree unclear what to do next save onlySing the song she wanted sung back to her.
