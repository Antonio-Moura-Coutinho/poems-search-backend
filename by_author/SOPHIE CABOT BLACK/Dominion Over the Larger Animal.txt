
How many times I have providedFor your death; the apple turned one wayThen the other, an arrangement made, The softer ground. To hold your head As if this mattered, to say what I thinkEssential into your ear,To watch the eye look everywhere to findWhat it does not know it looks for.To fasten you down in the one placeWhere no one can say anything more,Being nothing else but breath leaving,While the man with the needle stands byUntil the signal of how it is time. To believeI know what will happen next; to leave the hill As the body stiffens; to pass each blossomOf blood in the snow as if I understood All I was capable of.
