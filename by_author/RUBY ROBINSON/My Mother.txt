She said all sorts of things.We saw a duck pond and a man with a tubof maggots and a tub of sweet corn, we sawthe walled garden and the old-fashioned libraryin the park, stopped for a cup of tea in a cafewhere we had the cornflake cake cut into halveswith the handle of a plastic fork. We saw yellowcrocuses growing in a ring around a naked tree,the sky showing in purple triangles betweenthe branches. We looked in the windowof Butterworth’s at the bikes: they were beautiful,all of them. Gorgeous, she said. The sun waspushing through the iced air and landing on uson our heads and our shoulders and the backsof our legs. We bought nail varnish removerfrom Wilko’s, a bath sheet, and two Diet Cokes.She said she’d been talking to Jesus and Godbecause she didn’t want to go to hell, although,she said, correctly, we’ve been through hellalready, haven’t we. She said a woman shouldknow her place, should wait. She lit a cigarette.
