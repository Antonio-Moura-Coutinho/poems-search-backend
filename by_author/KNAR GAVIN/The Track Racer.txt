A hoot is a hilarious person. Perhaps trainscream or owl, jeer. Often done by mouth.A man may widen owl wide and give one away.Hoots may result in bans, as in, “the crowd ‘hooted’the track star clean out of the sport.”Sometimes a hoot may be kept and savedfor later. For instance, “They didn’t give a hoot.”A woman may sharpen a hootin the toolshed with the bread knives. So theremay be a toolshed, and this may be where the knives are keptand the hoots. They come from chambers — come at you with those wings. So when waiting in the tool-shed hoot runs its owl talon over the knives. Elseit comes at you, other it stares. • In 1890, George “Little Chocolate” Dixon put hisfoot on the world and held it there, waiting for the Majorto come. These were the days when extra layersof name were glazed on — a way of saying both moreand less and not at all. In the case of the two-term moniker,permit either/or — you may grab from the bag “Little.” In France,Marshall “Major” Taylor was le Nègre Volant — you may grab from the bag “Flying.”• Sometimes it’s a bad investment to self-publishautobiography — what a hoot. As in, pauperismmay wait for you with its long needlesreadying to blow you out. Under the pauper’s empty tona man gets baby-bird gaping with hunger. The Majorputs his wings inside and dies in Cook County Hospitalwhere it’s too late. Hoot given, hoot held back. Ice-white nursescome warm in their linens to fold back the wings besidethemselves, like any good cook come to shut a mouth.This case of hoot has called for leg and wing and swoop.Rise up, Major. Ghost-man old Birdie Munger’s bike — take back the front, it’s time to owl.
