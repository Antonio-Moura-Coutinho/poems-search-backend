I retired and kneltSeeking the throne of grace, but inly feltNo heavenly visitation upwards drawMy feeble mind, nor cheering ray impart.Ah me! before the Eternal Sire I broughtThe unquiet silence of confused ThoughtAnd shapeless feelings: my o'erwhelmed HeartTrembled: & vacant tears stream'd down my face.And now once more, O Lord! to thee I bend,Lover of souls! and groan for future grace,That, ere my Babe youth's perilous maze have trod,Thy overshadowing Spirit may descendAnd he be born again, a child of God!
