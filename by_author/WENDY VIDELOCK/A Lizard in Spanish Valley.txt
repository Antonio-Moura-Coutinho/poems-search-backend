
A lizard does not make a sound,it has no song,it does not share my love affairswith flannel sheets,bearded men, interlockingsilver rings, the moon, the sea, or ink.But sitting here the afternoon,I’ve come to believewe do share a love affairand a belief —in wink, blink, stone,and heat. Also, air.This is not a fable,nor is it bliss. Impatience,remember this.
