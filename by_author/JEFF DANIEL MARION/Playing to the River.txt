She does not know we hearâ€” she is playing to the river,a song for the water, the flowof an unknown melody to the rocky bluffs beyond, for the mistthat was this morning, shroudof past lives: fishermenand riverboat gamblers, tugboat captainsand log raftsmen, pioneer and native slipping through the eddies of time. She plays for them all, both dirgeand surging hymn, for what has passed and is passing as we slipinto the currents of traffic,the changed light bearing us away.
