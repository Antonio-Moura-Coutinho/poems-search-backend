
One rainy night we sat in trafficand, overtired in back, you sawa wind-whipped grocery bag afloatbeyond the clutch of jagged branches, swept by gusts and whirled in eddies.A sudden downdraft swooped it earthward, where it danced till with a whoosha current luffed it past the power lines. Disowned by gravity, small ghostnot yet snagged by twiggy fingers,it couldnâ€™t reach the earth. Thin-skinned,it pulsed, translucent jellyfish.You wept and pled to be let outinto the dark and slanted rain,somehow to save that desolate thing.The light turned green and still you begged, Go back, go back, on its behalf,caught and held, bossed and tossedby a will much greater than its own.
