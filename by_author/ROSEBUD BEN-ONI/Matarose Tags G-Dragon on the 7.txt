Matarose never comes home
She’s hungry like a wolf
She’s rosa de mota in lacroix
all the girls hail on queens boulevard
All the views she’s killed
in the name of iman
& yasmin le bon
Mata’s quite meta
Mata means kill
Rose a curve
from the real meat of it all
She’s part my little pony
into bronies she has loved & loved not
by astro-pony
compatibility chart
She’s the queerest part of me
What’s left after the clubs close
& has yet to go
home she never goes when
she writes I always write
in bed just woofed down
a 3 musketeers                          mata’s on
a mission which is to say I’m
my most           queer my most mata-rose when she& I don’t need all the girlsin the yarddon’t needall the girls in the yardby which I meanthe one
who’s not the one whose blocked
texts & torn up wish you wells
flicker still      That riddle
get you killed kindof a woman for whom
matarose almost cut off a foot
Went to the end of twobuck
ghosting railsMy man is a little afraid
of mata            he accepts her tho
Lets her come & go
because I stay I am always
with him because mata
just wants every 7 train
to dissolve into g-dragon
sound wants you to howlboom mata mataboom mata matawowg-mata dragonrose
