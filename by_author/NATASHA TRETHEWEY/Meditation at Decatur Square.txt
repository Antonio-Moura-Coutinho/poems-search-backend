In which I try to decipher
                          the story it tells,
this syntax of monuments                          flanking the old courthouse:
                                       here, a rough outline
like the torso of a woman                          great with child—                                       a steatite boulder from which                          the Indians girdled the core
                                                     to make of it a bowl,                                       and left in the stone a wound; here,
the bronze figure of Thomas Jefferson,                                       quill in hand, inscribing                          a language of freedom,                                                    a creation story—                                       his hand poised at the word                           happiness. There is not yet an ending,                                       no period—the single mark,
intended or misprinted, that changes                          the meaning of everything.
Here too, for the Confederacy,
                          an obelisk, oblivious
               in its name—a word                          that also meant the symbol
to denote, in ancient manuscripts,               the spurious, corrupt, or doubtful;
                                             at its base, forged                          in concrete, a narrative               of valor, virtue, states' rights. 
Here, it is only the history of a word,                          obelisk,               that points us toward                          what's not there; all of it
palimpsest, each mute object                repeating a single refrain:                Remember this.
