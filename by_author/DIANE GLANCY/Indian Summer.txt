
Thereâ€™s a farm auction up the road.Wind has its bid in for the leaves.Already bugs flurry the headlightsbetween cornfields at night.If this world were permanent,I could dance full as the squaw dresson the clothesline.I would not see winterin the square of white yard-light on the wall.But something tugs at me.The world is at a loss and I am part of itmigrating daily.Everything is up for grabslike a box of farm tools broken open.I hear the spirits often in the gardenand along the shore of corn.I know this place is not mine.I hear them up the road again.This world is a horizon, an open sea.Behind the house, the white iceberg of the barn.
