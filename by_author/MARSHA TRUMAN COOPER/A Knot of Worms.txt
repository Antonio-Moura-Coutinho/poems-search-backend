It was onlyabout another half mile tothe aspen grove and our worm digs.The humus, spongy and almostblack, turned over easily.I used my bare hands to putsome moist earth into a coffee canand, as the aspen glitteredin the risen sun, I gentlyslid the fresh, fat bait into my container.I heard the worms still in the groundgurgle as they tried to escape,while the ones in the can beganto ball up as their numbers grew.Streamside, surrounded by mountainswith snow lingering into summer,I picked out a worm and my dadarranged it on the hook to savemy small fingers. Now you can purchasea time-share on that land.The colony of aspen, thinnedby the builders, continues totremble. No amount of honkingbrings back the worms.
