
The sound of the water jarempties in the open graveswhere the refugees live.Because it does not touch menear my pillowI can sleep and dream of  the clean linesof  summer. What I thoughtwere faces turn outto be elaborate plates of sweetsnot this human sadness.One or two inches abovemy head until the mosquitosticks his snoutinto my dream.
