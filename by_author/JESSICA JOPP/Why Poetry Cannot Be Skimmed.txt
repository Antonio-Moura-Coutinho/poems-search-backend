The barn was in the Netherlands,in a field where fierce night windcaught the straw as if to fusethe winter stars to their coldness.A farmer, woken by the sound, knowinghis animals would be agitated,walked to the barn and by lanternbrushed the tails of his horses.In calming them he gatheredmany long, gleaming strandsof their nut-brown hair. Given overto what he heard in the swishing of their tails—the lash, the taut string of grief, turned slow,persistence turned to rhythmic movement—he hoped that if he listened long enoughthe layered sound would become a salve.He rolled the strands together, laid outalong the windowsills of the barn.Then, once dry enough in spring,he rolled them in paraffin waxto preserve the soundand left them to absorball the varied rays of sun, the spillsof rain, and then snow flying fastacross the latched windows and the slats,the rhythm of other breathing,animals plodding by the barn walls.The wax melted as the years progressedand other horses resided in the stalls,and their tail strands were addedto the aging threads.  From that encased sounddeepening over years, a rope,pulled strong and taut, would resonate.Then another generation worked the landand waxed the horse-tail cord again,and in turn when it caughtthat century’s light, was spuninto amber. Woven into the cells of hair:the tones of canal and field,pasture, furrows of plough,leaf and shadow, straw and stone,the human calling, the animal uttering.And when melted again, incrementallystrands from other horses living therewere added until there were enoughlayers of sound, set with the nourishmentof grass and salt, to be given awayand the space the hair had occupiedwould be returned to emptiness.The horse-hair cord was broughtby a farmer to a luthier’s shopalong a canal, and it was a perfect fit,she said, for a violin bowshe had carved a few months earlier,waiting, and for the bow-less violinsomeone had just given her.  She knewrosin carrying a current throughpastures, filled thirst, and the griefof night wind and scavenged applesmade the gathered pieces a whole.And now they are together in your handsthis moment to makeunrehearsed, immediate,after all those animals’ years,when you bring the instrument to your chin,when you raise the hair-strung bow,again their elemental sounding,and then their measured note, their first.
