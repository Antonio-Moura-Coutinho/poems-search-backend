Because of me. You’re welcome.The postman rattles up with your counter offer and I’m offto a yoga class avoiding your call yes like the plaguebecause son you can readin the dark and I have nohiding place left.You know me too well and you know it.We walk hand in hand down the hill into the Castroavoiding the nudist protest not because we are afraid butbecause we already know all about this city, its engineered  foundations,the earthquake-proofed buildings, the sea walls.No tempest will catch us unawarewhile we claim our share ofthe province of penumbral affections.You have no reason to trust me but I swear I liedown in this metal box as it thunders and looksinside my brain. I am terrified nothingis wrong because otherwisehow will I rewrite the maps unmooreda deep sea a moor a cosmonautWho needs saving morethan the one who forgothow the lazy cartographer mislabeledhis birthplace as Loss?Riding the bus out to the end of the lines and backI collect trash for art, oil spill, spent forest, the mindis at work and everything is at stake. I demandstatehood for my states of mind, senatorsfor my failure, my disappointment, the slanderand my brain unmapped reveals noexplanation for danger the ground untamed.I make paintings of nothing andstand before them like mirrors.I recently became a man but I do not want to let go of my weakness,instead want to meet God in heaven and in long psychotropic odeshave Him send me again digging in the dirt to unleashtantric animal governors to lay down the orgasmic law twice skewered and miserablein the old photographs, miserable in my body, huddlednext to my mother, recently permed and aglow so unawareof what is about to hit her. I am the answer to Bhanu’s question: “Who is responsible for the suffering of your mother?” and so sickI considered that sicknesscould bring us closer and Shahid and Allen in heavenslap me silly because they want me to know thatthis world is worth itstrembling. At the next table over a mothertries to reconcile her bickering sons. I haveno brother but the oneI invent has always got my back, he drownsout the mullahs so my mother canhear me finally. In a different book Jesusnever suffered, never was flogged or diedwent whole into heaven without passion.Shall I then deny myself passport through the stark placesunsalvageable, imagine it, the Motherof Sorrows did never grieve in the new seasontrees smell of semen and the tectonic platesmake their latest explosive move:to transubstantiate my claimby unveiling this city down to its stone.Everyone I know wants to dousethe hungry flames, flee the endless aftershocks,unravel every vexing question.You owe me this witness.I owe you the fire.
