He would leap at the blushof dawn to clean the paths and the steps spotless.Gugoo was a bootmaker girl who made boots.Gugoo was higher caste than Mugoo. By rightshe was the floor and she was the foot that trod.Yet after work, while the boys and girls playedat tug of war, wrestling, or archery, shy boy Mugooand shy girl Gugoo would draw the boys and girls.The children smiling at the shining visions would hugMugoo and Gugoo. Then that couple would burythe drawings for fear their elders feel scandalized.In manhood for Mugoo and womanhood for Gugoo,how hard that Gugoo thread boots for her fatherwhen she had no golden stitch for the gaping holein her soul. How hard that Mugoo scrub the lanes!Who dare be swept away from the law of casteby the foul stamp and passport of besotted love?Yet the hairs at their ears, their nipples, bompedby a mere sultana breeze. Then the swirling nightwhen they’d escape for Arabia than stay near-far    ...    In Mugoo and Gugoo Love was a rabbit leaping ona radish when they became runaway lovers! Like haresunder the sketched moon they bobbed in the grunch wind before the tossed river. Timorous Gugooto timorous Mugoo, “Is it not said the pure of heartare able to turn water into solid crystal orbs?”“I have heard it Gugoo. Let us swim till the watersturn dot by dot into crystal orbs, slowly mountingup for us a solid path so we can bobble across.”That cub-like couple held on a first-ever daredevilcuddle. Then snuck a parched kiss! And fell intotheir dive across Punjab’s muggur of an ogre — theriver Ravi! They were soon to learn the blunderouswater was bigger than they; they were dabbing onwardson the spot; directionless comical pups; pawdawdling    ...    Only Death was woken by their swallowed screams.At the sight of a cutesome pair brinked for his mawDeath’s thin lips aah’d and coo’d. To tickle himselfDeath tipped a witching shriek in the eardrumsof the ferryman, Charan, who was rank in a dream.Charan swore at Death, “What bastard panchodis unheroing my dream? I was the River Godriding the turmeric sea when the fisher king’sred bill fished me up a buxom masala mermaid!”Death hushed Charan. Bundled him into the boat.Charan, still swearing, fished for a scream-trail, for bunny-like feet in the sudden dead-stop river    ...    Next morning, by the prophecy of the snake-priest,the villagers arrived at the shame-faced riverbank.Charan, in his guzzy saffron turban, was blaringat the crowd about a passion crime. Huffing toohad arrived the muscly cobbler and sweeper fathers.All heard Charan, “I am my own King of the Sticks!I row two weeks that way to the flowers of Kashmirthe gold-haired men with their bloated bags of honey,and one week that way for the spices of Samarkandwith the red-fingered sellers of kalonji, saffron, jeera.Today I catch by the feet a fresh parable of a kutcha-pucka business. I sing it for only one rupee each!”All looked down by Charan’s sandal’d feet.Dared to be rolled in the same shivering blanket(like a chapati rolled around saag paneer)yet fearing to be parted, yet tenuously panting wereMugoo and Gugoo! The frail couple like shy redsquirrels, “O father, we love you. But. Most we are    ...    loving this: this that is my soul’s mirror. Mugoo is my Gugoo: Gugoo is my Mugoo.” The bony youthsclung sauced together. Stiffed for the glooping apart.The bootmaker father been crunching his own fists,the sweeper father been hurling daggers from his eyes,as the crowd fell silent, the fathers spoke as one,“What draws them out of caste, their underhandidle drawings. Such fancy is inking good for nothing.”Gugoo and Mugoo raised their necks, “If all heartswere good for nothing, could love from each for eachblow as one?” The apricot breeze blew a soft cadencebut could it push the dominion of the communal mindpast its bound and daily utility? Could sweet nothingsclear the world free of blood fear? Of sweet-faced Mugoo and Gugoo in a threadbare pleading, “Do notpart us.” From their mild rhetoric and politic of Lovethe hills and valleys had swooned into blossoms ofheaven, and had set the scene with gaudiest cheeks.So who dare part them? O Love, be roused, take armsand wound for the cause of love! Or at least shacklethe shadows that deepened into that tinsy couple.
