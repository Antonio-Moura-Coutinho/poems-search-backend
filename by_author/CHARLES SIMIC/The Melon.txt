
There was a melon fresh from the gardenSo ripe the knife slurped As it cut it into six slices. The children were going back to school.Their mother, passing out paper plates,Would not live to see the leaves fall. I remember a hornet, too, that flew inThrough the open window Mad to taste the sweet fruitWhile we ducked and screamed,Covered our heads and faces,And sat laughing after it was gone.
