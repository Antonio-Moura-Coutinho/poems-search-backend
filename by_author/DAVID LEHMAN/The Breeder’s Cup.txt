TO THE FATESThey cannot keep the peaceor their hands off each other,breed not yet preach the old discredited creed.Love is charity conceived as a coin dropped in a beggar’s cup.Reason not the need. Gluttony is no nicer than greedor wrath, but lustis our categorical must.We have no choice but to breed. II. OLYMPIAOlympia lies on her couchwith an insolent stare,her hand hiding her crotch,a flower in her hair.She splits the lot of us with a sneer: we are either breeders or queer.We will fight wars because of her.She will root us on. We will win.The face in the mirror is not brave,but we crave contact with her skinand the jewel in the mouth of her cave.She tempts like a sinand under her spell we fallinto a deep enchanted sleep,and wake up ready to make the leap,ready to heed her call,only now we’re alone,on streets less friendly than wilderness,a platoon of ex-pals in Manhattan.Olympia tempts like a sin,but then sends us home to the wife,commands us to resume the lifewe had planned to give up in her honor:the life of a dutiful husband, a modest successin his profession, impressive in credentials, in mood depressive(but nothing that a pill won’t cure).You ask if he is happy? “Sure.”And Olympia lies on her couch,with her insolent stare,her hand hiding her crotch,a flower in her hair.
