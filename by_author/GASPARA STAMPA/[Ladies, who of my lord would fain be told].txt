
Ladies, who of my lord would fain be told,Picture a gentle knight, full sweet to see,Though young in years, in wisdom passing old,Model of glory and of valiancy;Fair-haired, bright colour glowing in his face,Tall and well-set, broad-shouldered, finally,In all his parts a paragon of graceExcept in loving wantonly, ah me!   Who'd know myself, picture a woman wroughtIn passion and in presence after pain'sAnd death's own bitter images, a portOf safety where untroubled rest remains;One who with neither tears, nor sighs, nor zestWakes pity in her cruel lover's breast.
