
Deeply repentant of my sinful waysAnd of my trivial, manifold desires,Of squandering, alas, these few brief daysOf fugitive life in tending love's vain fires,To Thee, Lord, Who dost move hard hearts again,And render warmth unto the frozen snow,And lighten every bitter load of painFor those who with Thy sacred ardours glow,   To Thee I turn, O stretch forth Thy right handAnd from this whirlpool rescue me, for IWithout Thine aid could never reach the land;O willingly for us didst suffer loss,And to redeem mankind hung on the Cross,O gentle Saviour, leave me not to die.
