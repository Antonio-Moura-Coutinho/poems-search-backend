Nose hairs,for instance, and sideburns, the skin seasickas we’re made to play dress-up one final time.A daughter’s bracelet slipped over a wrist,and, for the ring finger, a lightning bolt ring.How far we venture from a love of peanut butterand Wonder Bread, how far from a Stutz Bearcatand Kahlil Gibran. From codeine, meperidine,diazepam, the room with the teddy bearsand the empty syringe. How farfrom the last book we dived into to learnabout sexual positions and astrological signs.And far, too, from the myth of our baritonescoming alive in Tupelo, of how we could turn onand off the rain. “That’s the way the mop flops,”I think he’d say, as they lay him out flatunder the chandelier, then in the limousine.“That’s the way the mop flops,” as five menenter his mausoleum with water, cement,and a wheelbarrow full of sand,the instruments set down, the stage lights dimmed,“Thank you very much! Goodnight, Graceland.”
