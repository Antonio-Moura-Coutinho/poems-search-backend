
Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;     There are four seasons in the mind of man:He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear     Takes in all beauty with an easy span:He has his Summer, when luxuriously     Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he lovesTo ruminate, and by such dreaming high     Is nearest unto heaven: quiet covesHis soul has in its Autumn, when his wings     He furleth close; contented so to lookOn mists in idlenessâ€”to let fair things     Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,Or else he would forego his mortal nature.
