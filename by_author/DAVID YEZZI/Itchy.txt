And now you’re in the throesof ecstasy, eyes lolling in your skull, as if sensing the first time the joy one takes                     in being purely animal.             It’s so good to have a scratch,though isn’t it a drag living like this,jounced on a high wire of impulses,every wish the same programmed responseto another signal passed from cell to cell,amounting in the end to a distraction—if truth be told—from rarer things, thoughts free                     from the anchor-chain of self?             For even the least sweetness, webehave like the old man on the low wallI saw outside the hospital today,who had his hand inside his flannel shirt,scratching at his chest, trancelike, agog,his eyelids fluttering like butterfliesin a meadow of snowy Queen Anne’s lace.                     I never saw him stop.             Such root satisfaction is likethe dying desert legionnaire’s in films, when he finds, against all odds, a water jug  and, lifting it, delights to feel it heavy.The score swells, his eyes relume. He tugs the stopper out, then fills his mouth with sand.Though, worse: we’ve seen the film; we know it’s sand;                     we gulp it anyway.
