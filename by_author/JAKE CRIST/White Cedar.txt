It rises in a Champaign County bog
Amid bedstraw and skunk cabbage,
Rises out there in an ice age
River valley gorged with glacial till,
And swills the moraine-filtered rainwater
With the wafer ash and honeysuckle.
Stalwart, set apart, and biblical — 
As if one of that ancient company
That gave its coniferous canonical body
To the tent that shuttled God
Through the wilderness.•
They say that cedar and cypress
Are the protectors of  bones.
You see them from the freeway, standing alone,
Statuesque and serious,
In the dead middle of and vigilant
In beanfields, where farmers used to plant
Their families.•Who are you like in your greatness?
Consider a cedar of Lebanon, with fair boughs
And forest shade, and of great height,
Its top among the clouds.
