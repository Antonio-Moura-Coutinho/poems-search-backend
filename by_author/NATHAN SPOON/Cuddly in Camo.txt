
Here comes rain on our roof!
It stays just long enough
to tickle me into writing this.
It stays just long enough
for everybody to get into
a pair of PJs (silk-cotton blend)
and then goes poof! At our best
we exude awesomeness. At our best
we are destined to turn pale
with the rest of humanity.
We are awesome and quick as
decomposing sticks at a trail’s
end. We bend dreams into circles
of green zone satire. We have
mahogany stuffed in our mahogany
ears. To all who are not us
we are sorry to say You’re welcome!
Nature thankfully adores a rumor!
A sunset! A glacier! Clouds
glimmer and cast inevitable
shadows off the groundswell
footrest. I remember you from
that time before we first met
when our eyes were wet
like summertime coasters
as we Ubered noiselessly
between pews. The aristocrats
are failing to panhandle via email.
One aristocrat is sleepily winding
through the face of another.
