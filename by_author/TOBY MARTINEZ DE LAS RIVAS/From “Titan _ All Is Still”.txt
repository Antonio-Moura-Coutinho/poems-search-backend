I am so gratefulto yóu, that breathes as the deadbreathe in their shallow land — barely,below the range of my hearing.That draws in the thin streams of black air& shifts & puts a white arm around me.I want to know, Né, what it is likein the kingdom of the dead where you are.Is the one I fear there with her trainof silver hair? Have you seen John, the templesof his glasses duct-taped to the hinge?I know it is not still there; I know everythingis in furious motion beneaththe black sun & the sky white as chalk — the torrent of silver hair whippedabout her face that woke in the moonlighton the last morning, lucid & fluent,& turned toward my father & said, “I love you,”walking backward on the white roadinto the white sky toward the white city,black sun clearing the horizon &a wind lifting in the torn leaves like the windin the wood above Lady’s Walkwhere I trespassed in spring, singing,Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more, the bluebellshissing like cats & the canopya violent array, violently outside mein flickering Islamic greens / Spanish grays,the topside / bellyside of milledleaves, the harebells biting their bitter tongues,& raising its head in panic, a juvenilefallow deer stippled with thick white spots.Then someone shouted, “Oy, stay there, you fúck,”Oyé, Whale, & my launces in his side,& I went down the hill with the sweetgrasspulling at me & the spit in my mouth.Né, I cannot sleep. Ever since I lost my little children.I look for their shapes on the ceiling,in the dark, & they are not there.Né, never, no, no, never, never, never, never.There is nothing, Né. Neither the nightnor the white city like Conholt in its great estate.Not the hart, nor the furious wood.O,           John, John. I came downstairs still drunkto find you asleep with your headon the hoover, & the hoover still running;half-shaved, the tape on your glasses,your mouth open & the tattered Crombie.Then years later when Oli called & you were,O John. Y am alpha and oo, the firsteand the laste, bigynnyng and ende.O,           John, John. No white city as a wijf ourned to hir hosebonde,no voice in the wind, in the (clouds) cryingLo! Y make alle thingis newe. I make all things new.Como una novia adornada para su esposo.Como tu cuerpo en la noche, Né; like this bodythat pregnancies have raged over& I have loved with my mouth moost feithful and trewe.i              And let him that is athirst come.ii             And let him that heareth say, Come.iii            And let the dawn thunder up in the streetwhile you are sleeping with the first cars saunteringby & the dustmen & women whistling.Lord, I will stand before yóu when yóu wishin death’s little house & yóu will eat my pronoun.
 
• In that other life that will be ourswhere there is neither marriage nor children,I may kneel beside you, Mouse, & notknow you — our eyes like a golem’s, emptyof their own will, but full of hís,the dead Lord at the center of hís dead city.In the days when my glory is strippedfrom me, & yours from you, & all are madeequal — no aesthetic splendor, no charm,no subversive, faithless glances to-ward those I have loved & have loved me;no property, no desire, no variation,no sparrowhawk thrusting through birchesin the snow toward the wood, forhé never stepped in a wood, nor saw a harebelleasing its frail metaled head, its lightpinks & papery blues, through the first trancheof snow in November, nor the gray cereof the plunderer beneath her blue helmet,her single attention, wings volute in air,head w/ beak narrowly ajar in concentration& hunger breaking the line of the fenceat the old house in Broadway;in the snow; in the snow that has flattenedeverything, the bells ringing out,the clouds heaped above the Blackdownsdragging themselves from the earth,headlights on the ridge in the wind gropingtoward them, the hills featureless,snuffed, white, black, dull, shining w/ no light.No drinking in the afternoon, no dope,no flaring temper. No bed to sleepit off, Mouse, while you draw catkins & piggies& pussybears with gorgeous happy frownsin the cold. No sleep, no flesh to restin, for there is only day in the white irradiatecity where the lamb lights hís terriblemercy in to worldis of worldis, forever & ever& hís government will never fail, for no gloryis allowed but hís glory, no bonegouvernance but hís bone gouvernance,no prison camp but hís prison camp,hís plantations, hís will & techne, hís punishmentbeatings, hís censorship, hís textual criticism,hís forgiveness, hís rehabilitation, Oferdful men, & vnbileueful & cursid & manquelleris.Mouse, on that day, will you turn toward me& will I see in the insubstantial glassof your eyes the memory of these days;myself, father, authority, half chocolate & halfsteel, still carrying you at six up the hill& down the hill, still playing the Ticklepuss& Crocopotamus, the horn of plenty,salver, lessener of cries, bringer of swallows& dragonflies, the Emperor & Downy Emeraldhovering over still waters in the valei of teeris,wolves in the mist in the hillsabove Antequera where the rocks baredthemselves like teeth & you wereasleep on my chest with fine alabastereyelids & eyelashes plashed with droplets of dew?Where I said, “Shhhhhh, close your eyes& imagine that you’re a water reed, Mouse,”& I blew on you & that was the wind& then my hand was a snail wandering overyour eyelids & the nape of your neck& last of all it rained & that was my fingersgoing pitter-pat upon the pinnacles of your head.The days fade through our slow parting;your mother grows ambivalent. Little accident,in the stillness of the earth there is no life;the harebell reaches its root into death& the waters flow down until the rock is dry.I wanted more than I was given,& found in betrayal a churning courage.Torchlight in the garden where we make our choice.The will that flickers. My loss. Our bliss.Mouse, on the last day, remember this.
 
• Lying with you, Né, in the sun, in the (clouds)half-listening to the Senegalese preachertwo mornings after the riotswhen they ran Mame Mbaye down to the gutter& wishing you would go buy your mutes& play again, here, in silence, — for them & for me & yourself & the polis — Bach’s Suiten für Violoncello No. 1.To watch in dumb show the formal motionsthat reify language & music — the flesh;your shoulder & forearm & wrist& lightly-draped fingers one continuousdependent assemblage flowing south to the riverat Arganzuela & the chuckling magpies.There is an authority in you, when you play,that is different from the authorityof the whap | whap of rotor blades overhead;control that is liberation, a concentrationthat is neither at one point nor diffuse,like the globes of light hovering over the lamppostsin your myopia last night; wanderingacross the river, the madrileñosalso entonados swaying like palm frondsin the wind; then the dark, & our one bodywith its artifacts of pregnancy & loss.An authority that is different from the authorityof the Lord in hís dead city, hís kingdomthat has no contiguity with ours, no conformitá,the streets empty of opposition& neither wind nor rain; nor thunder, nor tears.Now a thin sun is dwelling in the wind.I wd like to reach out to you in its cold light& pull the shape of your body into mine;put my tongue against your eyesso I can taste what it is you see through them;the restaurant opening, the crisp cloths.Even the polis with their holsters & war clubslooking on carefully & asexuallylike angels come to lie with the daughters of men.A kestrel on a lamppost strips the bascinetfrom a cricket with slow, consideratemotions: lovely rare flame.Have they buried Mame Mbaye? They are erasinga name from the wall & the quarter is pacified.Clouds rise above Guadarrama,Somosierra, above the meseta like kites.The picoletos shift from foot to foot in longblack boots. Bells bleat — lambs;Alsatians on leashes. The bougainvillea — glad to bring us at last the first traceof its colors — flaunts a breathless restraint.
