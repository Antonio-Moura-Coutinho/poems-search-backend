
On the threshold of half a house in the Land of Israel my father stoodpointing to the sides and saying:Upon these ruinsone day we will build a kitchento cook in it a Leviathanâ€™s tailand a wild bull,upon these ruinswe will build a corner for prayerto make room for a bit of holiness.My father remained on the thresholdand I, my entire life,have been erecting scaffoldingreaching up to the sky.
