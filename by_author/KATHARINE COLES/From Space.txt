From up hereIt’s an ordinary box with gravelSpread over its lid, weighting it, butInside it’s full of shadows and sky.Clouds pull themselves over dryGrass, which, if  I’m not mistaken, will eruptAny minute in flame. Only A spark, a sunbeam focused. From up Here, enjoying the view, I can finally Take you in. Will you wave back? I keepSlingshotting around. There’s gravityFor you, but all I ever wanted was to fly.
