
We keep trying to kill it, split it, hackIt to itsy bits. We suspend itOn the wall where we can see itPassing. We hang it around our necksOr wrists, laying pulse next toPulse as if each might like Company. Ba-bump, etc. Rising And setting has everything to doWith it. In the afternoon we feel soLazy we try not to close our eyesAnd jerk awake, wondering what hasPassed, and where did we goFor that suspended hour,And could anything keep us here.
