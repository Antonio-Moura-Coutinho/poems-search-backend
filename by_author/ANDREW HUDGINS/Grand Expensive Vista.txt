
As we sipped and mingled,regaledwith oldfangledcanapés and beguiled,or entertained at least, by gargledoldies, I disengagedand angledacross grass tenderly groomed,past where electric tiki torches gleamed,and, alone, gazed,now truly beguiled,at my hosts’ grandexpensive vista, mortgaged,yes, and, yes, remortgaged.A low goldmoon glowedagainst a plush black sky gauzed,even filigreed,with stars. Gownedin old-growth oaks glazedwith moonlight over their autumn gilt,the hills glowedin concord with the golden moon. I lingered,glad—discomfited and glad—at what my friends’ greedfor beauty afforded me. I argued,self against self, what they’d gainedand lost, and me with them, entangledas friendship entangles. I nearly groanedaloud with want before my friend grabbedmy elbow. “Gorgeous, eh?” I grinnedand agreed,my voice greasedwith hidden envy. From behind us, grilledsirloin, pedigreedmeat sublimating on embers, triggeredanother hunger. Life was not just good,but too good:aged beef, aged wine after bourbon. We hungered,and all the way back to his engorgedglass table, hunger was our guide.
