He said he wrote about the narrow Bow BridgeFor peds built in 1878 which is sad and fineAnd always photographed through branches in the foregrineWhich was sufficiently sad to make him weep all the tineHe was trying to write the poem so he threw it away.He tried again and he uncontrollably wept agine.Did you try a third tine,I asked. No, he said, and here’s why:Life is uncontrollably sad all the timeUnless we divert ourselves with art objects,Sex, or tequila or beer, and if we tell the truthAbout this, for instance when we feel itWhile looking at a photograph of the cast ineBow Bridge or see in life not photos but the real bridge at a short destineAway with the actual park and branches around us,We feel like killing ourselves to stop the painOr as you, Arthur, call it, the pine,So I didn’t try a third timeTo write the poem. Get off this line,He said. Wait! Don’t hang up, he said, I take it back, stay on the phine!Well, I considered calling on my second longer distance lineKenneth who in heavine has changed his name to Kenneth KineAnd Barbara who I did call on my second longer distance lineWith Hart on hold and affirmed her name change to Barbara GineBut I didn’t ask those younger two about uncontrollable totally dominant sadnessOr whether they had discarded their own poems about the 36 cast ineBridges for people to walk on in Central ParkBecause they were weeping on the paper and pineIng for Hart’s Big Deep Salty Lake to ease the pine.I didn’t call Frank because I never knew hine I mean him.I figured the next step was mine.So if you can believe it I hung up on Hart Crine.
