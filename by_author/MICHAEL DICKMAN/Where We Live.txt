I used to live in a mother now I livein a sunflowerBlinded by the silverwareBlinded by the refrigeratorI sit on a sidewalk in the sunflower and its yellow downpourThe light of  the worldbeads up on one perfect green leafIt scribbles its name on every living thing then erases it so what’s left is more of a whisper than a motherHere it’s spring Over and over and over again  • I used to livein a cloud now I livein a crowIt’s tiny and crippled in there but I can find my way to the bathroom in the dark if   I need toAll the windows in the crow are left open and let the clouds inBack inThey float past my bed and have nothing to sayHello it’s nice to meet you!From a telephone pole tongues slide out singing welcome home Welcome home they sing• I used to live in a tree now I livein a kingHe waves his arms in front of   him and endless migrations of   birds disappear into his coatI like to sit up inside his crown eating sandwiches and watching tvHills shake in the distance when he shuffles his feetFloods when he snaps his fingersI bow inside his brow and the afternoon stretches outOrders more sandwichesAnd sells the slavesand sets the slaves freeand sells the slaves
