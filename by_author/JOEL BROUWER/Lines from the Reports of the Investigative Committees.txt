Beneath three thousand feet, the sea is wholly dark.The shuttle feeds hydraulics to the blind shear ramand represents a single failure point for disconnect.Recommendation: Declare selected points on earthinvisible. Affected communities have been providedwith limited quantities of powdered milkand other staples. Many questions remain. Someclose their eyes under water instinctively.Imagination can create a sense of peril whereno real peril exists. Safety equipment testswere necessarily imaginary; mechanisms in questionwere wholly inaccessible. A journalist sinkinginto the mud was told to toss his camerato a colleague and hold extremely still. In thissense, we are our own prisoners. Investigatorshave salt in their hair and sand in their teeth.The hotel pool is empty. Yet questions remain.Barbeque billboards depict grinning pigs in apronsand toques. Cleanup crews recover thousandsof plastic milk jugs from the shallows. Do theseimages appeal to the death drive? Care should betaken to ensure the highest possible reliabilityfrom that valve. Thousands in affected communitieshave been evicted and live in tents. Demonstratorshave prevented investigators from accessing hotel stairwells. 1900: Rudolf Diesel demonstrates an engine fueled by peanut oil at the Paris World’s Fair. The Vietnamese owner of Bad Bob’s bbq Buffet tells a journalistshe last drank powdered milk in a refugee camp “a thousand years ago.” Items available onlyin limited quantities are found in Appendix C. Cleanup crews have stacked thousands of drums of dispersant in hotel parking lots. Dominant failure combinations for well control suggest additional safety mechanism diversityand redundancy provide additional reliability. Bank of America will offer limited foreclosure deferments in affected communities. Thousands of years ago, a pronghorn ram slipped beneath the surface of a tar pit, jerking its snoutfor air. Recommendation: Live at inaccessible elevations. Recommendation: Close your eyes. Recommendation: Prevent access to the invisible. Engineering reports noted required safety mechanisms were unlikely to function yet were required for safety’s sake. If the committeemay offer an analogy, a blind surgeon is dangerous, an imaginary surgeon harmless. Still, questions remain. BP’s 2010 Q1 replacement cost profit was $5,598 million, compared with $2,387 million a year ago, an increase of 135%. Unlimited quantities of peanuts are available. However,care must be taken to ensure continued high reliability of the shuttle valve, since it is extremely critical to the overall disconnect operation. Phenomena not meant to be accessed or imagined are found in Appendix E. Cleanup crews are sometimes idled for lack of fuel. 1913: Dieselfound dead, drowned under suspicious circumstances. The investigators’ hotel toilets won’t flush. Midas turned everything he touched to gold. In this sense, seabirds cloaked in oil are rich.Cleanup crews live in tents and are provided with limited quantities of barbeque and wear white canvas jumpsuits like prisoners on furlough. If the committee may offer an analogy, the death drive resides at wholly dark depths of imagination and fuel issues from a wound we’ve opened there.
