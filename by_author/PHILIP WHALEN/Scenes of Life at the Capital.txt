Having returned at last and being carefully seated
On the floor—somebody else's floor, as usual—
Far away across that ocean which looked
Through Newport windows years ago—somebody else's livingroom—
Another messed-up weedy garden
Tall floppy improbably red flowers

There are two long-bearded apprehensive gremlins
One beside each of my ears. The left-hand one
Very gently whispers, "Hello?" and
Listens for a reply from the other side.
He repeats, "Hello?" very softly. "Are you
Still there?" And the right-hand one listening
And nodding, his own ear turned towards that furry dark
Pink and lavender cave. Presently he replies
(Also very softly) "Hello!"

27 MORE SHOPPING DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS
                                             Fred, is that music?
Ah, no, my foolish darling
It is only the roaring of the aged chilling blood
Sluggishly perambulating your brittle veins you forgot
Your bloodpressure pills again, too busy to go out
They brought you three dead sandwiches upon a tray
And coffee, tepid black forbidden coffee
On a tray and you lost your temper on the telephone
And now it echoes in your hollow empty wooden head
                              I’m not afraid of you.
                              You’re nothing but an incubus.

Shut up.
What’s the use of having a cold if nobody cares.
Why not simply do something else.
An absolute mystery: how to stop and begin differently.

Inconveniently: lunchtime. Several villages,
Tomb of the Emperor Uda, deserted superhighway to Western Hills
I thought of asking somebody, “This the road to China?”
I really knew where I was, I’d been to those mountains
The empty freeway bored and frightened me
Broken highway to a pretty place where I bought expensive   
noodles
Well, it opened up a space, I could see the distance, for a   
change
Breathe. Did I miss nine trillion cars, want them to be
On this road with me?

The cold weather is neither monster nor prodigy
I seem to survive it (Vitamin C) in spite of paranoia

In winter the air is cold as it is hot in summer
But I never can understand the idea
All too soon I must leave these beauties
And come away to heaven’s boring towers of golden flapping
Snowy wings and halo bright star crown
No more to see your sexy frown and freckles
                           (“I can’t find my mirror!
                           I can’t find my things!”)
So that when you’ve at last arrived there too
Shall we bleak and holy strangers distant forgiving nod and   
smile?
But soon you’ll be asking me, “How do I look?
Is my halo all right? I know my wings are all slaunch-wise
Along the trailing edge.” (Preen, preen.) “I wish I had
My mirror, Kids! I wish I had all my things Oh well
I don’t care please hold me I want you to hang onto me a   
while.”
Torn paper fake mountains become three-dimensional
Transparent crystals. Bushes and trees all
Barbered and shaved plaques of tourmaline, emerald
They used to tell me I must apply myself   
Work hard and don’t be lazy
But what I must learn is to accomplish everything
Which has nothing to do with work.
Work is what an instrument or engine does.
We say a crystal changes white light to green
Breaks light into rainbow, scatters it
Focuses to burning point. The crystal does
Nothing. Its shape and structure make all
The difference. Think of transistors and lasers.
In order to make this day great
Yesterday must be altered
Rain I must wear overcoat muffler and bamboo umbrella
Thinking of monkey tribes on Hieizan and Iwatayama
Wet & freezing I hope they’re finding food
Lovely bronze-green fur, defenseless eyes
They run if you stare at them:
Fixed gaze prepares for pounce crunch fangs of death
All monkies everywhere look worried all the time
Eyes and faces, Oh God, what next. Me?”
Lots of instructions wasted
Go down town and argue with the bank
Fall, as leap

6th month, 1180—
       “To north the land rose up high along a ridge of hills and   
to the south sloped down to the sea. The roar of the waves made   
a constant din and the salt winds were of a terrible severity.   
The palace was in the mountains, and, suggesting as it did the   
log construction of the ancient palaces, was not without its   
charms. . . . The manners of the capital had suddenly changed   
and were now exactly like those of rustic soldiers.”

Ancient Orient! Shortest route to the forebrain
Through olfactory lobes. Longest way round is
The shortest way home. A little trip
Through the Anima Mundi, now show
Now currently appearing a persistent vision
When it happens at the correct speed
But if you get too close it is only
Patterns of light
Drop candy and try to follow it
Creates new place and time. Looking up
I see blank staring faces
Reflecting steady silver glow. Silence.

I LOVE YOU—what better way to remember?”

No matter how far we travel
We find most of the world living as quasi-civilized
Nomads among polished marble ruins of great cultures
The quality of life and the meaning of these remains
Are quite imperfectly known to us, no matter how skillfully
We parse the verbs of lost languages
All ignorantly we project our own savagery & cannibalism
Upon societies and individuals who were

Chanted his mantra and bowed. I also rubbed
Magic water on my head. Old lady caretaker

Cleaning up &c. APPEARS so to us
But as a collection of “event particles”

She looks at the moon through that window that you see
Over there. She is now a wax dummy with a face

Features. All dressed up in Heian court robes
Long black hair down her back. In the antechamber
A smaller dummy represents girl-child attendant
Grinding ink at a large inkstone
The figure of Murasaki holds a writing brush
And a long piece of paper. Her head has begun to turn
Away from the writing to observe the moon
And quite likely to remark upon the song of the uguisu
Scholars, Japanese and Western, say she never did
Never was here a minute. The priest shows
A sutra copied out in Murasaki's own handwriting
Here's the very inkstone that she used.
