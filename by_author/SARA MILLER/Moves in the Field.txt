
Had to come in out of the people,they blew me about so.Was told of the life taking placeelsewhere. Went to check on that,flying late and low over the west.Saw no house, no shade.Sat down on the damp bankon the far shore at the leftedge of the world, against whichthe sea endlessly lapped.So now there were two of us,who beat the world byday and caressed it by nightand the world didn’t sayyea and she didn’t say nay.
