
Last night in bedI mouthed a prayerof my own composition.It sounded offhand, it was carelesslyaddressed, it twisted my meaningentirely, it left an ache,I didn’t know what I was doing.So I took down my yellowed copyof French With Picturesby the late literary critic I.A. Richardsand I put my petitioninto soft French words.I.A. Richards believed that ironywas the language of redemption.He wrote and lectured famously on this,but his masterpiece was French With Pictures.“The chapeau is on the table.”“The man with the beard stands before the window.”“She comes from a village by the sea.”There is no improving the old traditions.They are already mortal, partial, and wrong.The woman at the table by the windowputs her head into her hands.“Into your hands,” she said.
