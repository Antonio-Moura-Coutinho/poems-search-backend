The lifeline on Betty Lou’s beautiful hand ended the day after tomorrow,so I told her how the restof our lives is vastly over-rated, even in neighboring galaxies.When she asked me how I knew so much, I said I watchedWar of the Worlds six timesand, if she went with me tothe double-feature tomorrow,I’d finish explaining the universe.I smiled winningly.
