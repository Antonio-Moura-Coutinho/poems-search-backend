
When no one else would listen, Saint Anthonypreached seaward, his words fishnet for the lostsouls of the heretics. Caught up in despair, we pleato the one who will listen: Saint Anthony,please return Tía’s teeth or the misplaced key to our bolted hopes. Patron retriever of all we’ve tossed when no one else would. Listen, Saint Anthony,teach us to steward this world, all our netted loss.
