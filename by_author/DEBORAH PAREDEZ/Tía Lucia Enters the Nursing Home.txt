By noon I kneel to button hercoat, tie the scarf to keep her hood in place.This is her first snow so she strains againstthe ritual, spooked silent then whining, restless under each buffeting layer,uncertain how to settle into thisleashing. I manage at last to tunnelher hands into mittens and she barks andwonâ€™t stop barking, her hands suddenly paws.She is reduced to another being,barking, barking all day in these restraints.For days after, she howls into her hands,the only way she tells me she wants out.
