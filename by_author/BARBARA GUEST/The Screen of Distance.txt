On a wall shadowed by lights from the distance
is the screen. Icons come to it dressed in capes
and their eyes reflect the journeys their nomadic
eyes reach from level earth. Narratives are in
the room where the screen waits suspended like
the frame of a girder the worker will place upon
an axis and thus make a frame which he fills with
a plot or a quarter inch of poetry to encourage
nature into his building and the tree leaning
against it, the tree casting language upon the screen.

The telephone is Flaubert’s parrot and it flitters
from perch to perch across the city. Or someone
is holding the dead thing in her hand in a remote
hotel. A sensitive person with a disability who
speaks to the inanimate. She may even resemble
Louise Colet or the helpful niece. She hasn’t sent
her meaning and I am absent in these reminiscences
of her. The telephone is the guignol of
messages.
It may have been cold moving down from roofs,
a continental wind caught between buildings.
Leaves and pollen blowing onto fire escapes.
Windstruck hambones lying in a gutter. Equinoc-
tial changes the body knows, the hand feels, the
truck passes without notice and buildings con-
tinue their nervous commitments. The earth may
have been moaning underneath this junk. I am
caught in the wind’s draft.

At night viewing the screen of distance
with shadowy icons framed by light
I understood the rasping interior
was rearing other icons,
No longer gentle they flashed ripened clauses,
or images raised formidable projections of ice,
the wall was placed in a temporary position
where words glittered from a dark cover,
Narcissism lived in a silver hut.

In the lighter time of year words arrived
concealed in branches. Flaubert exchanged
himself for words, night became a night of
words and a journey a journey of words, and
so on.
Words became “a superior joke”, I trembled
under a revolutionary weight, a coward fleeing
from a cloud. The ego of words stretched to
the room’s borders assuming the sonorous
movement of a poem.

I entice this novice poem with a mineral, Beryl.
The dictionary bestows on Beryl a skittish description,
         like a sequence in which a car
         moves over ruptured roads and slices
         into ghost veins of color—
         a camera follows each turn,
         examines the exits where rock protects
         a visionary tool that prods it:—         “A light greenish blue that is bluer
         and deeper than average aqua,
         greener than robin’s eggs blue,
         bluer and paler than turquoise
         blue and greener and deeper than beryl
         blue—a light greenish blue that is bluer
         and paler than beryl or average turquoise blue—
         bluer and slightly paler than aqua.”
