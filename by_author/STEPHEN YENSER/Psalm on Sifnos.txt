
One does not want,O Lord, to heapUp by still watersOf words a cairnBut hopes to attendA small covertOf tamariskWhose leaves saltyYet featheryWill shed light overA thickened plot.One wants at lastTo cede the fieldTo tamariskAnd mastic tree,To olive and stone,Stones in the fruit,Seed in the stones.
