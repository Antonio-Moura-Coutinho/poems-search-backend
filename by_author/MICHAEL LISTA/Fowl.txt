
The girl from Scarborough liked being slappedDown the hall from where her mother slept.A big, hard-working hand, anybody’sTo come medicinally down, antibodyTo the slow infection of   her Western face(what sucked the most was that it wasn’t fast).Some birds don’t migrate. Above, two lonely fowlScream across the sky their only vowel. This river I step in is not the riverI stand in. We’ll drive to Leslieville, wherever, Park in the Guildwood GO lot and get stoned.Who’s there? Nay, answer me. StandAnd unfold yourself. Her heart begins to pound.No geese go winging to the rooky pondNo goslings disappear their small and speckled. If we endure this, it will make us special.
