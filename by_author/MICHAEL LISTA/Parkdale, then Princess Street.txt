The rooms are plain where I am interviewed,Abstract and clinical, and so I glory Like a corpse plant, perfume the marble-facedWith the reek and prodigy of my tomorrows. Dying is so boring as the soulRummages the liquidation saleFor a final bargain —But time outbids all comers, and we dieExpensively in Princess MargaretWho was herself once so beautiful.
