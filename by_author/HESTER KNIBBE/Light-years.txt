Includethe wingèd M, voluptuous Venus, hotheaded Mars, that lucky devilJ and cranky Saturn, of course, plusU and N and the wanderer P, in short the whole solar family, complete with its Milky Way, and count up all the othersystems with dots and spots and inthat endless emptiness what you’ve got is a commotion of you-know-what. It’s a beautifuluniverse, you said, just take a good lookthrough the desert’s dark glasses for instance or on your backin seas of grass, take a good lookat the deluge of that Rorschach—we’re standing out theresomewhere, together.
