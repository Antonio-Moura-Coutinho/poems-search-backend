
your values aren’t right
for this age
or memory
 
color line. globes
of the Sea
survive revelation
 
as the Moon reflects
its own interior
revolver. I live
 
as a condemned
callused body
under salt water sand, far from your destructions. where are
 
the people of the lost (shut out the hate)
arc, in a service (love so remote)
to more water? worn
 
eclipse of a human
emergence, foils of the barricade
a face speaks
 
from isomorphic ferns
lines of sacrifice
burn the god of a naked mammal
 
I am the Loon
“the silence of our
beautiful consciousness”
 
“in love with everything
you make it impossible to be myself in this
place. where can I go?” – Baraka
 
attentive score
for the core
of death: black, red, and white as I wake
 
an expansive heart
absorbs all the evil
a veil of the world
 
and cancels
the Loon’s empty
submergence
 
for more of the deep
currents of the light’s
darkest refuge. I am the Loon
 
I hunt with blood in my eyes
 
I wander in the morning
and float above
the wound fish of the spirits
