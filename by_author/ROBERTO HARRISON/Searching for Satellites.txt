
the news
is released
 
for the secret
of worlds, I reach
 
the end
of my laughter
 
and breathe
to the night sky
 
a periodically
interrupted song
 
to reach the forest
of my refuge, here
 
where the lights are
where one dissolves
 
and appears. to see the hidden
files of your mind
 
and listen
 
listen
 
as I cross the road
to find the fox
 
of the funeral home’s
bewildering delight
 
where there is laughter
marked by a mysterious
 
blinking light
 
that the occluded
erase the sun with, and I’ve lost
 
my heart
for the present moment, as I fear
 
it is one more day
to see others walk
 
in the dark morning
of imposters
 
and timeless life. I say
farewell to you, my love
 
as I enter the darkness
to be with you
 
in our morning kisses, and see
that we shall never part
 
your heart
 
as the Sea was parted
as the world collapses
 
and we say ‘yes’
to the fearsome light
