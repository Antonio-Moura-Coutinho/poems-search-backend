april 1 
found on our driveway
  like a feather dropped     by a crow
 

  8 of spades,        a playing    card /
 

       we played Crazy Eights, slapping        cards or holding them        as if they were birds that might fly        out of our hands 
decades ago, in our childhood
       like the translucent, whirling        image I imagine, prismatic and phosphorescent —         a murmuration of starlings swooping        and iridescent 
but it dissolved onto a gray wall, undecorated
       / glimpses of us wearing our        velvet Sunday best dresses, yours        usually crimson, mine blue
 

       we never had nice shoes. 
Now you have returned to water
 thanks to the Neptune Society spreading        your ashes over the Pacific

Ceylon tea — that amber cup
            from Sri Lanka, popularly known here, before
            Americans became tea drinkers, as
                 Orange Pekoe;
                        our mother hated
                        so many things — 
                                              tea was
                                   rattlesnake venom to
                                                                     her
            I embraced it  ///
            What did you drink, Marilyn? I saw you only
with a Coke or a glass of wine in your hand?
Our mother whom you felt
damaged you / your life       spirals, the twisting iridescent birds
              fly at me now                       scintillating, spinning
                                     I blink
(Our mother drank many cups of coffee with cream a day.)
Our sad mother
                                   I blink
                                   and tell it to go back to our childhood
                                   of muddy little shoes from walking in
                                   the spider-filled orange groves.
There, the damaging must have Begun  / she
                                   loving me so much
                                                                      more
                                                                      than you.
I wish there had been more stories
like the one about the origin of her disliking tea
            at 17, she went to celebrate being made teacher
            of the one-room school she had attended and
            graduated from at her retiring teacher’s
            home, she was served for the first time — tea, she
            being from a German coffee-drinking family.
            Our mother hated it but politely choked it down.
            Would never again touch a drop of the
            poisonous beverage.
From that story, we learned that
our mother ritualized hating something — expected us
to admire her for it.
                        I took
                        that negative pattern
                        and spun it until I could have cloth enough
for an eloquent garment. Perhaps the lesson simply made you
feel yourself            helpless         ragged                      torn
I never
saw you that way, Marilyn,
though perhaps incomplete.
I pour a cup of Assam. Take a sip,
            let it wash through my mouth,
                        down my age-damaged throat,
think
of you sitting
with me in your Southern California 
backyard one May morning
next to the camellia bush.
I, as always with a cup of tea in my hand.
You, smoking.
I left all my family — you were part of it — 
left California and reinvented myself, even
mythologized myself as a tan “California Girl.”
You did not become an artist or a poet.
I suppose that’s why you felt damaged.
If only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice
it took for me to get away.
                        So many small things
                                   can save us
                                             from the damage
you talked of. For me, drinking that
first cup of Orange Pekoe
and making tea
my drink      risking rattlesnake poison
with every steaming cup,
a tiny emblem of a rebellion I still try to practice.
You left us so quickly, Marilyn,
and without any warning this January,
your house full of cancelled aspirations — glass
bowls, and cylinders, and huge globes
filled with sea scallop shells
            you combed the California seashores to 
                        find, collecting these empty shells, washed
free of their biological life.                                 Out of the ocean:
we two different daughters of a sailor.

The spinning                      the scissors               the measuring
and thus our lives are given out
from the heavens, with unfair allotments
and varied, unaccountable fates,
born when we are, and to whom
you would have prevailed
in an age where women had to spin,
weave the material, cut it into britches and dresses,
undergarments and sheets, sew
and keep clean, warm, and comfortable a
household full or a castle full / men
children, hired hands, maidservants — you would have
done it
so well.
But you would have died young in such a world — 
diabetes, asthma, chronic bronchial infections
even in the 21st century where you lived to be
76       a world where all your skills were plied as
            substitute
for being an artist.
                      When I asked you a year ago,
not knowing that you would die this January,
what you would most like to have, if
money were not the object
             — since clearly all your measuring, cutting, and sewing
            had been for economical reasons,
            not art — 
you thought for a bit, raising your chin.
“A swimming pool in my backyard. One I could
step into every morning, swim, float — maybe in the afternoon
I’d go for a dip. Many evenings, I think,” she said
to me.                     Longing for some ocean? 
In our portrait,
if someone paints it, she will be 
sitting in a scallop shell,
her many jars of seashells behind her head. I
will be invisible, except for the spinning 
murmuration of birds that radiates
            past me. 
They read at her funeral, a poem from her journal
about lying on the beach,
the sand embracing her.
How much she loved it / felt safe,
felt released. Oh, Marilyn, all
those seashells emptied of their living
fleshy occupants. (the ugly parts that die and rot) now
glorious empty rooms
            in which to live an imaginary life,
                        to decorate,
to create beauty, 
            spaces to live
                        a different life.
What is left but your desires, locked in glass, and
an image of you walking
your beloved beaches, hands 
full of seashells, your
footprints measured, then quickly filled 
with the tidal flow.

my spinning, 
            a whirlpool of faceted moving lights
                        Everything is Numbers!
down into a vortical glare that replaces
            my own mind’s desire 
                        Everything is Numbers! Everything is Numbers!
floating down
            like the crow’s
                        onyx feather
the 8
            of spades
                        random card
appearing
            last week
                        over gravel
8 legs on a spider,
            the arachnid so many people seem to
            fear, yet I lose track of time, stare into the wall
            or any space to replace real images with my imaginary
            ones, some random spider, who spins my fate
Crazy Eights, the child card game Marilyn and I played
pieces of eight, the dollar of
            pirate Spain — our childhood in Orange County
8, a vertical infinity sign
            everything is numbers / your
                        fire opal that Daddy brought
to you from India, and our mother
paid a jeweler to set it
into a ring. You wore the ring
more than sixty years. I suppose it was
on your finger at death
spinning,     spinning
to scintillate and iridesce
            We never had nice shoes.

Easter Sunday. You and I always dyed
Easter eggs together, our mother busy at
her forty-hour-a-week bookkeeper’s job. I 
was intrigued with the colors,
but they never turned out so bright when
coloring the eggs. You, the artist,
were interested in the designs
to transfer onto the eggs,
cartoons, bunnies,
chicks.
We kept our eggs
separated from each other,
put them in separate bowls, neither
caring for the other’s creation. Still we
felt connected, even joyful, on those few holiday projects.
Not enough to make us friends.
My unwillingness to be like our classmates
embarrassed you. You chose invisibility
in school, rather than being known as “Diane’s
Sister.” 
That unwillingness to be like others 
was what made me a poet. So many little things, but that early decision
of yours, not to understand why I wanted to be weird,
is what made you make so 
many other small choices, preventing you 
from becoming an artist. “Look away,” our mother said to us,
when there were ugly things confronting us. 
I could not do that. You blame
our mother, yet it was you who decided to look away,
even though it meant not seeing the whole world,
even if meant you didn’t become an artist.
Poverty, of course, was the reason
we never had nice shoes.

All numbers have
disappeared
                        instead
            there are mushrooms
            fungi that has always seemed
            more artful than tasty
            Sipping a cup of tea / soothes me
            as the mushrooms in a veloute sauce
            never could.
            I feel stymied / a rider
            with no horse. I want only to watch
            the stories unfold / the secret stories about why
            you chose to marry and have children / why
            I did not / the stories
                                    I try to banish
            blot out, replace with the diamond
            dog. A murmuration of iridescent starlings, 
            and the spider of eight, 
            twirling on its silk line, projecting infinity      art
            is made when you subject yourself
            to the unacceptable, then dredge
            yourself out,
                                    find a mineral replacement:
            infinity
            iridescer
            irised feather
            scintillater
                        a crystalline body whirls
            releasing me from
            the history, the stories it’s
            so hard to tell.
Until recent years, my sister
and I either ignored or disliked each other.
We fought continuously as children.
I have in my wrist a black bump that
protrudes near a vein.
                                    It’s the point of a pencil
that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled
for the long yellow weapon.
A pencil, the weapon of a writer. But there was 
no bleeding, no seeming-wound to be dressed. 
We never told
our Mother, both too ashamed
of our brutality. I’ve never asked a doctor
about it, the pencil lead encapsulated
in my wrist. Nor ever spoken
of it to anyone.
I always wonder that so much must remain a secret?
Why
            we never had nice shoes.

Young Marilyn, Old Marilyn.
there are places on this planet where
I find it hard to detect any beauty
therefore, silence

Drinking
a blend of traditional
Darjeeling with a touch of Ceylon / this
tea takes me back to a Viennese visit, drinking
this very tea in the afternoon while my friend, Jonathan,
ate their famous Sacher torte.
The tea
seemed particularly aromatic — 
            “lightly scented with oil of bergamot
            and a hint of genuine Bourbon vanilla.”
Wishing for the moment in the past to reappear. I didn’t know
the tea from the Sacher Hotel
was as famous as the cake
                                until I found in my Upton Tea catalogue
                                a listing for “Scented Darjeeling”
                                under the heading “Earl Grey Blends”
This tea,
any cup of tea!
Hard to believe. no! Sad to
think my Mother almost spat out her first taste
of tea.
What worldly thing must I touch to
bring Marilyn back into my
sedate life, my sister Marilyn who died in January? 
Her hand — I’d like to imagine timidly touching her
      hand — Marilyn’s hand.
            Her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring.
                        In that hand she’d be holding a cigarette.
Smoke and fire makes me think of her — 
            not water, though it was that Pacific ocean 
                        filled with seashells
                                    that she was in touch with. My old hands,
not really like hers at all. She had big hands for shaping things,
            while mine are small,      like birds.
