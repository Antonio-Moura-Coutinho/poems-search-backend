
The hunter to the husbandmanPays tribute since our love began,And to love-loyalty dedicatesThe phantom kills he meditates.Let me embrace, embracing you,Beauty of other shape and hue,Odd glinting graces of which noneShone more than candle to your sun;Your well-kissed hand was beckoning meIn unfamiliar imagery.Smile your forgiveness: each bright ghostDives in loveâ€™s glory and is lostYielding your comprehensive prideA homage, even to suicide.
