
Words fall out of my coat pocket,soak in bleach water. I touch everyone’sdirty dollars. Maslow’s got everything on me.Fourteen hours on my feet. No breaks.No smokes or lunch. Blank-eyed movements:trash bags, coffee burner, fingers numb.I am hourly protestations and false smiles.The clock clicks its slow slowing.Faces blur in a stream of  hurried soccer games,sunlight, and church certainty. I have nopoem to carry, no material illusions.Cola spilled on hands, so sticky fingered,I’m far from poems. I’d write of politicians,refineries, and a border’s barbed wire,but I am unlearning America’s languageswith a mop. In a summer-hot redpolyester top, I sell lotto tickets. Cars wait for gasbillowing black. Killing time has new meaning.A jackhammer breaks apart a life. The slow globespirals, and at night black space has me dizzy.Visionaries off their meds and wacked outmeth heads sing to me. A panicky fear of robberyand humiliation drips with my sweat.Words some say are weeping twilight and sunrise.I am drawn to dramas, the couple arguing, the manheadbutting his wife in the parking lot.911: no metered aubade, and nobody butmyself to blame.
