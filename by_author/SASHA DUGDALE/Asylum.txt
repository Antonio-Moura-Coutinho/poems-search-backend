You say the old masters never got it wrong,But when Goya painted the death of the imaginationIt was a lost dog against a usurious yellow skyAnd the dog, a hapless creature who had drawn itselfTen miles on two legs, stared in amazementTo see the man who once fed him from his plateReduced to this. So I felt this week, the vile soil and everything upon it—The beggar guest kicked from the tableBefore his own dog, and even the honest unpickingOf art performed nightly and in seclusion.Like any Penelope my armor is resignationAlthough I thought I would lift the bow myselfAnd draw.By the morning he is goneAnd what to make of this?The prostitutes hang from a beam like miceThe suitors are piled unburied in the yard.And some say that it is now much betterAnd others, that it is worse.So order was restoredI stared in amazement                                               •Perhaps Akhmatova was rightWhen she wrote who knows what shitWhat tip, what pile of wasteBrings forth the tender verseLike hogweed, like the fat hen under the fenceLike the unbearable present tenseWho knows what ill, what strifeWhat crude shack of a lifeAnd how it twists sweetly about the broken sill:Pressingness, another word for honeysuckleBut housewives? Has poetryEver deepened in the pailWas it ever found in the sink, under the tableDid it rise in the oven, quietly ableTo outhowl the hoover?Does it press more than the children’s supperThe sudden sleepless wail?Did it ever?It lives. It takes seedLike the most unforgiving weedGrows wilder as the child grows olderAnd spits on dreams, did I sayHow it thrives in the ashen family nest Or how iambs are measured bestWhere it hurts:With the heel of an iron On the reluctant breast Of a shirt?                                               ﻿•                              MICHAEL BLANNThere was a hush, then Michael BlannStepped out onto the stage. MichaelBlann, with his pipe and his jukebox headOh, he’s your man.He has a song for all weathers, a pipeAnd a voice, and he sings and he roamsHe sings to the wind and a dog of howThe trees are all bare and Jack’s come home.He’s a thin voice, like a spider thread On days when the sun is late and fineLive and let live, sings Michael BlannThe wind yields not, but the hills is mine.He’s no call for fate passing overHis sheep are all angels, the stars are his LordsHe’ll play any part the clouds should fancyTo humble tunes and hand-me-down wordsThe acts are written in briar strandsAnd the Pharisees are leaves in the airI likes a drop pipes Michael BlannSing follow hark forward the innocent hare. He wore to his end a clutch of sheep’s wool To show the gods that Michael BlannWent alone, alone for most of his yearsBut crossed the hills a singing man.
