Onlythe fixed and wandering stars: Orion rising sideways,Jupiter traversing the southwest like a great firefly,Venus trembling and faceted in the west—and the moon,appearing suddenly over your shoulder, brimmingand ovoid, ripe with light, lifting slowly, deliberately,wobbling slightly, while far below, the faithful searises up and follows.
