
Night, the fat serpent, slipped among the plants,Intent upon the apples of his eyes;A heavy bandoleer hung like a prizeAround his neck, and tropical red antsMounted his body, and he heard advance,Little by little, the thin female criesOf mortar shells. He thought of Paradise.Such is the vision that extremity grants.In the clean brightness of magnesiumFlares, there were seven angels by a tree.Their hair flashed diamonds, and they made him doubtThey were not really from Elysium.And his flesh opened like a peony,Red at the heart, white petals furling out.
