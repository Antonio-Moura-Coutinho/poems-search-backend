
I would invoke that manWho chipped for all posterity an ass             (The one that Jesus rode)Out of hard stone, and set its either wingAmong the wings of the most saintly clanOn Chartres Cathedral, and that it might sing             The praise to all who pass             Of its unearthly load,Hung from its neck a harp-like instrument.             I would invoke that man             To aid my argument.             The ass smiles on us all,Being astonished that an ass might rise             To such sure eminenceNot merely among asses but mankind,Simpers, almost, upon the western wallIn praise of folly, who midst sow and kine,             Saw with its foolish eyes             Gold, Myrrh, and FrankincenseEnter the stable door, against all odds.             The ass smiles on us all.             Our butt at last is God’s.             That man is but an ass—More perfectly, that ass is but a man             Who struggles to describeOur rich, contingent and substantial worldIn ideal signs: the dunged and pagan grass,Misted in summer, or the mother-of-pearled             Home of the bachelor-clam.             A cold and toothless tribeHas he for brothers, who would coldly think.             That man is but an ass             Who smells not his own stink.             For all his abstract styleSpeaks not to our humanity, and shows             Neither the purityOf heaven, nor the impurity beneath,And cannot see the feasted crocodileRinged with St. Francis’ birds to pick its teeth,             Nor can his thought disclose             To normal intimacy,Siamese twins, the double-beasted back,             For all his abstract style             Utters our chiefest lack.             Despite his abstract style,Pickerel will dawdle in their summer pools             Lit by the flitteringsOf light dashing the gusty surfaces,Or lie suspended among shades of bileAnd lime in fluent shift, for all he says.             And all the grey-haired mules,             Simple and neuter things,Will bray hosannas, blessing harp and wing.             For all his abstract style,             The ass will learn to sing.
