When sometimeDeath shall boil down unnecessary fatTo reach the nub of our identity,             When in the run of crimeThe skull is rifled for the gold in teeth,And chemistry has eaten from the spineSuperfluous life and vigor, why then heWill show a richness to be wondered at,             And shall be thought a mineWhose claim and stake are stone and floral wreath.The body burns away, and burning givesLight to the eye and moisture to the lipAnd warmth to our desires, but it burns             Whatever body livesInto extinction though it wear a plateOf armor in it: therefore do we thriveIn fear of fire, in terror of the shipThat carries us to fire. A soldier learns             To bear the silver weightWhere in his head the fire is most alive.
