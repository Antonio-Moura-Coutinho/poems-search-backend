I’ll tell you, if you really want to know:remember that day you lost two years agoat the rockpool where you sat and played the jewelerwith all those stones you’d stolen from the shore?Most of them went dark and nothing more,but sometimes one would blink the secret colorit had locked up somewhere in its stony sleep.This is how you knew the ones to keep.So I collect the dull things of the dayin which I see some possibilitybut which are dead and which have the surpriseI don’t know, and I’ve no pool to help me tell—so I look at them and look at them untilone thing makes a mirror in my eyesthen I paint it with the tear to make it bright.This is why I sit up through the night.
