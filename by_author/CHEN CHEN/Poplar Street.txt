Are you my new coworker? Oh. I see. No.Still, good to meet you. I’m trying out this thing where it’s goodto meet people. Maybe, beyond briefcases, we have some thingsin common. I like jelly beans. I’m afraid of death. I’m afraidof farting, even around people I love. Do you think your motherloves you when you fart? Does your mother love youall the time? Have you ever doubted?I like that the street we’re on is named after a tree,when there are none, poplar or otherwise. I wonder if a treehas ever been named after a street, whether that worked out.If I were a street, I hope I’d get a good name, not Mainor One-Way. One night I ran out of an apartment,down North Pleasant Street — it was soft & neighborlywith pines & oaks, it felt too hopeful,after what happened. After my mother’s lovebecame doubtful. After I told her I liked a boy & she wishedI had never been born. After she said she was afraidof me, terrified I might infect my brotherswith my abnormality. Sometimes, parents & childrenbecome the most common strangers. Eventually,a street appears where they can meet again.Or not. I’ve doubted my own love for my mother. I doubt.Do I have to forgive in order to love? Or do I have to lovefor forgiveness to even be possible? What do you think?I’m trying out this thing where questions about love & forgivenessare a form of work I’d rather not do alone. I’m trying to say,Let’s put our briefcases on our heads, in the sudden rain,& continue meeting as if we’ve just been given our names.
