
I have seen the black sheets laid out like carpetsunder the trees, catching the rainof  olives as they fell. Also the cerulean brightnessof   the one covering the bad roofof  a neighbor’s shed, the color the only color inside the winter’s weeks. Another onetook the shape of   the pile of   bricks underneath.Another flew off the back of a truck,black as a piano if a piano could rise into the air.I have seen the ones under bridges,the forms they make of sleep. I could go onthis way until the end of the page, even though what I have in my mind isn’t the thingitself, but the category of   belief that sees the thing as a shelter for what is beneath it.There is no shelter. You cannot put a tarp overa wave. You cannot put a tarpover a war. You cannot put a tarp over the brokenoil well miles under the ocean. There is no tarp for that raging figure in the mindthat sits in a corner and shreds receiptsand newspapers. There is no tarp for dread,whose only recourse is languageso approximate it hardly means what it means:He is not here. She is sick. She cannot rememberher name. He is old. He is ashamed.
