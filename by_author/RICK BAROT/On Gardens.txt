If you look at the word colony far enough, you see ittraveling back to the Latinof  inhabit, till, and cultivate. Words that would have meant somethingto the friar, walking among the village girlsas though in a field of flowers, knowingthat fucking was one way of   havinga foreign policy. As I write this, there’s snowfalling, which means that everyangry thought is as short-lived as a match.The night is its own white garden:snow on the fence, snow on the treestump, snow on the azalea bushes,their leaves hanging down like greenbats from the branches. I know it’s not fairto see qualities of injustice in the aestheticsof a garden, but somewhere betweenwhat the eye sees and what the mind thinks is the world, landscapes mangledinto sentences, one color read into rage.When the neighbors complainedthe roots of our cypress were bucklingtheir lot, my landlord cut the tree down.I didn’t know a living thing three stories highcould be so silent, until it was gone.Suddenly that sky. Suddenly all the lightin the windows, as though every sheetof glass was having a migraine.When I think about that grandmother whose name I don’t even know, I think ofwhat it would mean to make a gardenthat blooms black: peonies and gladiolasof deepest purple, tulips like ravens.Or a garden that doesn’t bloom at all: rockspoised on clean gravel. When the snow stops,I walk to see the quiet that has colonizedeverything. The main street is asleep, exceptfor the bus that goes by, bright as a cruise ship. There are sheet cakes of  snow on topof cars. In front of   houses, each lawnis as clean as paper, except where the first cator raccoon has walked across, each tracklike a barbed-wire sash on a white gown.
