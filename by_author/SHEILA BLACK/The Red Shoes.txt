And one nightat the Embajada I broke a tooth, and the very nextnight three teenagers were shot dead as they sat ata booth by the window eating mofongo. The neighborwoman used to sing a funny song from the fortiesabout a “road” and “clear day,” a fast car and a womanwith a pistol. You could see her back had been broken,and she dragged her left foot behind her down thestairs to the mail room. And Junior began smoking crack after his church on Columbus failed and startedgoing by his birth name which was  Jesus, until hefell in love with Irma of the hideous rabbit-fur-and-white-leather jacket, who stopped the cars by wavingher watery hands, smoothing her moth-bitten hairfrom her moon-pale face, the violet lipstick she always wore, until she wound up drowned in the EastRiver, and no one would say if it was suicide ormurder. But Junior said there were eels inside her andbegan preaching again, doped on the corner. Mr.Rodriguez fired him, though he didn’t want to, and afterMr. Rodriguez often looked sweaty and pale as he labored to move stuff to the basement, which he had once done with Junior to help him. We painted our rooms cinnamon, Aegean blue, repainted them eggshell, gris-perle.We fought, and you tore all my letters and diaries andsprinkled them out the window where they landed onthe roof of your car, plastered there by a violent summer storm. It took hours to scrape them off; I weptand Mr. Rodriguez gave me a small plastic-wrappedpacket of Kleenex and a month later you wound up in St.Luke’s on lockdown and Junior caught pneumonia, died that November. He was thirty-eight, though wehad believed him older. They buried him in CalvaryCemetery in Queens. Once I rode a cab out that way — we got lost, so many ticking minutes among theslender white spikes of the graves. The red slippers — they must have been for dancing, thin soled as if withmouse skin, a powder inside that might have been talc,rosin, or years of plaster dust, a piece of   broken ribbon,black at the edges as if   burned off or torn and smeared withshoe polish. Or the mice had gnawed it. And yousaid “The name of the film,” and I said I thought it was astory older by far, a girl who puts on the shoes and cannotget them off, who skips down a road, then another andacross the world, until her feet fall off, and her handsand they make her wooden ones.
