
My dolls have been put away like deadchildren in a chest I will carrywith me when I marry.I reach under my skirt to feela satin slip bought for this day. It is softas the inside of my thighs. My hairhas been nailed back with my mother’sblack hairpins to my skull. Her handsstretched my eyes open as she twistedbraids into a tight circle at the napeof my neck. I am to wash my own clothesand sheets from this day on, as ifthe fluids of my body were poison, as ifthe little trickle of blood I believetravels from my heart to the world wereshameful. Is not the blood of saints andmen in battle beautiful? Do Christ’s handsnot bleed into your eyes from His cross?At night I hear myself growing and waketo find my hands drifting of their own willto soothe skin stretched tightover my bones,I am wound like the guts of a clock,waiting for each hour to release me.
