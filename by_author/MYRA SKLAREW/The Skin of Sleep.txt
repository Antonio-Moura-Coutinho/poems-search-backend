
The skin of sleepis thin. It will not hold.Its contents stumble out.A nub of bonelodged in earthat the bottom of a pit.A stranger staringdown from the rim.The skin of sleep is thin.It cannot hold.Lost names spill out.Children engravedin ash. A sea of blood.Only you, tenderness,stillborn, beneaththe skin of sleep.
