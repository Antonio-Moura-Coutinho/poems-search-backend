I say we werenever silent. We read each other’s lips and saidone word four times. And laughed four timesin loving repetition. We read each other’s lips to uncoverthe poverty of laughter. Touch the asphalt with fingers to hear the cool earth of VasenkaDeposit ears into the raindrops on a fisherman’s tobacco hair.And whoever listens to me: beingthere, and not being, lost and foundand lost again: Thank you for the feather on my tongue,thank you for our argument that ends,thank you for my deafness, Lord, such firefrom a match you never lit.
