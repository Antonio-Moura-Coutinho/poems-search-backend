
I kissed a womanwhose freckles aroused our neighbors.Her trembling lipsmeant come to bed.Her hair falling down in the middleof the conversationmeant come to bed.I walked in my hospital of thoughts.Yes, I carried her off to bedon the chair of myhairy arms. But parted lipsmeant kiss my parted lips,I read those lipswithout understandingsoft lips meantkiss my soft lips.Such is a silence of a woman who speaks against silence, knowing silence is what moves us to speak.
