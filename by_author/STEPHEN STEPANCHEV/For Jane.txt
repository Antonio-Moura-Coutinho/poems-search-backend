
I know that rarity precedes extinction,Like that of the purple orchid in my garden,Whose sudden disappearance rattled me.Jane, in her way, is also beautiful.And therefore near extinction, I suppose.She is certainly rare and fragile of  bone.She insists she is dying, day by dubious day,And spends her evenings looking at photographsOf  her mother, who never believed in love.Rare Jane, I worship you. But I can’t denyYou access to the endlessWith its river of cold stars.
