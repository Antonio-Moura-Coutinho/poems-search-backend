Then was a differentcountry in a different climate in a time whensouls were won and lost in prairie tents. It was.It was. Then it was a dream. I had no will there.Then the new continent and the new wifeand the new language for no, for unsaved,for communion on credit. Then the daughterwho shouldâ€™ve been mine, and the hour a shadowoutgrew its body. She was all of my failures,my sermon on the tender comforts of hatredin the shape of a girl. Then the knowledgeof God like an apple in the mouth. I facedmy temptation. I touched its breasts withas much restraint as my need allowed,and I woke with its left hand traced againand again on my chest like a cave walldisfigured by right-handed gods who triedto escape the stone. It was holy. It was fading.My ring, then, on my finger like an ambush,as alive as fire. Then the trees offered me a cityin the shape of a word followed by a wordfollowed by a blue madonna swinging fromthe branches. A choir filed out of the junglesinging hallelujah like a victory march and it was.
