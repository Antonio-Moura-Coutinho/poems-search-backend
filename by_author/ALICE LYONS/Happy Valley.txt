
The brook is this mix of roar & hiss as if Godhas managed to scalpel a section of tempest & clothespin it inthe woods Over There Always draped in the treeswhile we eat white summer peaches from celadon bowlswhile the sun bleaches & blue jay squawks score the maple, oakbirch and apple-treed sky with their oblique Scriabin musics.Fifteen years since I have seen a real Fallher deciduous burlesque, her glistering things siftingon the old cider mill. A holy show.I hold a wooden fragrance & a sodden mush of crushedflowing apples in a cache and will never give it up.The cardinal is the best bird because it is a red markon the blank snow amid the charcoal Twombly of maple, oakbirch and apple branches. Pines are green & faraway, donâ€™t figure.My sister in spring is even prettier, her smilethe genuine quality of it undiminished in the many monthssince I have been in Happy Valley. It roars and is constantlyin spate because it has its reasons spring being spring plus my visiting.
