As I saw your face nearingmy face, snow fell througha keyhole and opened the door.We went inside and watchedwindows wax green and gold.Spring, we decided, was moreoppressive than winter withits alyssum and cloverand the sheer weight of lifecrowding us off the page.We stayed in bed for yearsand took our cures patientlyfrom each other’s cups.We read Bleak House andstored our money in socks.Nothing opened as we did.
