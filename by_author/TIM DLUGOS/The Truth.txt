The sun’sstrong, but the colors of the lawnwere washed out by the winter, not the light.February. Stained glass window of the housenext door takes the sun’s full brunt.It must look spectacularto the neighbor in my head,a white-haired woman with an airof dignity and grace, whothrough pools of the intensestcolors climbs the flight of stairs.I’ve never seen it,but I know it’s there.
