
I found my muster station, sir.My skin is patent leather.The tourists are recidivists.This calm is earthquake weather.I’ve used up all the mulligans.I’d kill to share a vice.The youngster reads a yellowed Oui.The socialite has lice.The Europe trip I finally tookwas rash and Polaroid,was gilt, confit, and bathhouse foam.And I cannot avoidthe end: I will not die in Paris,won’t rest for good behinda painted mausoleum door.The purser will not findme mummified beneath your tulle,and Paris will not burn.Today is Thursday, so I’ll die.Come help me pick my urn.
