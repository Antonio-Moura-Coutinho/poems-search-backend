The creature that had oncebeen a man handed over his petition,a stained and grimy scrap,handed it to his lord and master,a petition asking to be transferredto the status of a horse.You son-of-a-whore, the master,kicking for good measure, bellowed.What do you mean by this?The creature that had oncebeen a man, having considereddeeply his petition, answered:If I were a horse, I would haveone day off in ten. As is,I have none. As a horse,I could rest now and againduring work. As a formerman, I cannot. As a horse,I would be expected to performwork equal to my strength.As a prisoner, I am alwayshungry, and hungry, I work less and get less bread, so I can barely stand.A horse gets a stableand two blankets. I haveno blankets, no jacket.If a driver beatsa horse too hard, he is punished, for a horse is precious. If the brigadiersbeat and kick me, it is likebeating a tree. So you see,a prisoner is nothing here.But a horse? A horse is something!Inside the frozenand the broken vista, the plea had a ring of truth heardeven by the lordand master, who had previously been a man himself, and who, when no other former men could see, attached that name to the page, grantingthe horse a stable and two blankets.
