
Lord of wondrous workings,grant us understanding—      now at the hour of closing.
 
A chosen few are called,
     their eyes toward you lifting—
they stand exalted in their trembling      now, at the hour of closing.
 
They pour forth their souls;
     erase, then, their straying—
and grant them, Lord, your absolution      now at the hour of closing.
 
Be a shelter for them
     through all their suffering;
consign them only to rejoicing      now, at the hour of closing.
 
Show them your compassion,
     in your justice turning
on all who brought oppression to them—      now at the hour of closing.
 
Recall their fathers’ merit
     and count it as merit for them;
renew their days as once they were,      now, at the hour of closing.
 
Call for the year of grace—
     the remnant flock’s returning
to Oholìbah and Oholàh—      now at the hour of closing.
