Although it’s likely you’re on your ownat this moment in this city of three millionreading the poems of Traherne,and there was no one till you lit your lamp,the kingdom of childhood keeps being foundedin his voice and his seeing,which are a sort of birth. A birth goes onin the dark of a poor family, or a mother alone.Then comes the small bright circle of the faces:lover pores over sleeping loved one, parent over childin their enclosure we name home,a hut in the plain so bare there’s not a tongueof grass to make the wind hiss. Unknownto the world a world exists:trees and streams, birds all the colors of the flowers.So Traherne pours over youhis wild remembrance of the world to come. And wouldeven in the silence of his bookif it were lost and lay unopenedtwo hundred years. Even if he had diedbefore he sang the Eden in his look.
