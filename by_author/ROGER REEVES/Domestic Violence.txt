A Lowcountry marsh trembles with the blood of an African
Who refused to climb out of the salt and mud of the bay
And quite literally lost his head. A hunter named Hunter
Waits for the man’s wounds to close and for him to rise
Again. Some call this festive cruelty Paradise. Pleasure.
Demby, the African made to rise and suffer another shot,
Calls it the Afterlife, the unceasing blind world of death
He welcomed expecting the end to his captivity and exile.
But there is no end to the perfecting of cruelty even now
In the Afterlife, where a hawk humped up in the high weeds
And a house on fire are a congruent sadness, a brief history
Of nature’s one duty for flesh — decay, decay, decay ... 
Sometimes, it is as if every bird in the Afterlife trills this
One song. And I forget who I am, but then I look down
At my feet shuffling in darkness and hear my name — 
Till ... Till ... Till ... And I know I am no farmer, blade
Or mule driven over some roach-ragged road to field
And fray, and sometimes I forget how I came here to After-
Life, to pleasure, to domestic violence, to drive, be
Driven, and then I look down at my hands. It is a war
That brought you this peace, a war that brought you this peace.
And then, I heard a question: “Shall we kill all of the masters?”
And before I brokered an answer, I heard a voice say:
“Then, we must kill ourselves, first. And who will
Be left to kill the masters?” I turned to find nothing
But a boy in a tree and a girl beside him, their heads
Tolling in the wind like pecker-fretted fruit. Voice, I said,
Come now or do not come at all. And there, a man
I had seen before scratching in dust next to a drill field
With a dictionary and a strange astronomy for a face.
Ezra, is that you, I asked. “The peasants’ bent shoulders,
Odysseus and the dead bullock — call me whatever you’d like.
I come to every name like a white ox toward Pisa
And the butcher’s road. I come to Paradise dragged
By the hair ... with one day’s reading and surrendered
Temple.” You do talk funny, I said. “He do the police
In different voices,” he said. And when all the voices
sound like the police, I said, kill all the voices. And so ran.
I ran from Ezra who ran after me and demanded he be
My guide. “There is no running from the forest of men.
There is no running from men.” I’ll be damned, I said — 
But before I could finish Ezra said, “That’s right. Be damned.
Be here taloned and tumbling the sky down in Paradise.
Here. Be in your cage and free.” But here is not the here
I seek nor sought. For that here harangues me
And I might as well be the nigger coming over
The obstacle fence, a periplum of certain disaster,
A choir of empty cups sitting loudly before the famished,
Your prince, dear Ezra, hanging by his heels in the piazza,
The sprezzatura of maggots rummaging the round heart
For its divinity and pulse. Ezra, nothing of you but the dead.
And so, I ran past the possum running through the skull
Holes of a dead man lying in the fog that licked them
Into a wet testimony, the possum testifying, too, to their death — 
Coming, going, in ruins and floating out, out, beyond
Their murders and dropped plates, out beyond the Thame-ish
Rivers and its drowning traditions. And then I looked back
And saw Ezra. He had come to his cage and could go no farther.
“Till,” he said. “Bring me up from beneath these decks,
One slaver to another.” He winked and I winked back,
Handed him the katydid buzzing in my pocket, as I had done
Before, dug a trench around him as another had done before,
Then said, “Ezra, be here in your cage and free,” and ran.
And then I came upon a mountain and then a chasm
For which there was no bridge and so turned back
To find a possum running behind me, and I asked him,
Dear Possum, what do we do with this darkness
Between us, and the possum said nothing and ran on
Into the darkness, into the chasm and fell speaking of
The end of touch, the desire to forget desire, shadows,
The fear in a handful of dust, a woman’s mouth,
Fear I had known of and visited though now I cringed
At the thought of that violence, the violence that I brought — 
And so thought to throw myself, too, in that chasm
When a hand touched my shoulder, a voice said, “Not now,
Maybe never. On we go, dear boy, through this weather.
Let’s find us another theory of light. Or darkness.”
Then, she laughed, for it was a woman with a lit darkness
And a careful chin, glasses, her body a tin of tender.
What do you know of me, I asked. She said, “Louis,
I know of you as I know fog — that it comes on
Through the alleys and past the dead boys and girls
Who had not wanted to die in those alleys and ornament
The city’s sight. Louis,” she said. “I’ve known all your light.
But do you know mine?” And I hadn’t, I hadn’t.
“I was a taken city burning,” she said, “a burning house
Built to heal the sick, a sick house full of healing,
The owl, moccasin, and panther — a rising
For which there has never been such risen, the total
Black. I is the total black. Flame and fox and knot
Of the what-nots you would have forgotten if not for me,
I am perfect fucking memory, no-dominion-defied,
The god-head-glitter-gussied-up-for-the-going-down.”
And though I thought I saw I had not seen. Instead
Of one body, three. Women. And who and who and who,
I asked. They laughed at my asking and said, “You
Wouldn’t know us, but we will tell you our names — 
Mother, Song, and Holy Yoke. Audre, Gwendolyn,
And Lucille. Follow us. Or heel.” And where
And where should I follow you? They did not answer,
Instead, they walked on the edge of the abyss
Laughing as if the abyss. “We are what is whatnot,
The ever shimmying out of the never-wound.
Louis, do you follow or do you fall,”
They said. “Are you short or is you tall?”
And on and on they played, pleasured, and pigeoned
With each other, kiting sound and word between them
As I have seen lovers do, passing cigarettes and smoke
From one mouth to another, the smoke the shared body
Of a God that has no master or mastering plan
Other than abiding in darkness, abiding in both
Its coronation and crucifixion. On and on we walked.
And I followed. Beyond the bears chortling pears
From Augustine’s outstretched hand, out beyond the river
Scissoring the changing maple, its leaves ambering
Then auburn then green each time a child appeared
And touched its trunk. We stopped, watched. I asked
Who are they. And the one full of light and knives answered,
Waving at a few who journeyed to the edge of the water
But did not wade in. And why don’t they wade in,
I asked. She snickered, quieted, then said,
“Wind and foxes, what was never mine but was and was.”
As if she knew I did not understand, continued, “‘The ones
I got but did not get,’ the wild hair they could not grow
But scratches me now as it did once in a dream.
Our abortions, Louis, our ones given and gave. Dem.
The ones given all of their years at once. And none
Or never.” And when she spoke, I saw another come
To the shore and wave at me, a boy given and gave, the crushed-
Color of late evening long after the pickers have come
In and settled near a pot of ox bones boiling in the evening
Of their own water, once again predicting the arch
And strange astronomy of the flesh and its march march
March to October and the battered soil. I mean I turned
From the one waving because I could not be beneath
The stairs of his steering and stare. Paradise,
Why do you bring me to such weather? Why
Would any man come down from his noose for this?
“Because coming down is exactly the point.
All heavens lesser and below heaven. Noose, not ...    
You came to see what has become of death ...    ”
The women spoke as one who had many tongues —
All Holy Ghost and gut of a river gabbling over the white
Stones. And where are we going, I asked.
“Where language begins, Till.
                                              Paradise. But over there.”

                 And wasn’t this paradise that I had entered
Through the thick marsh waters out of the cane
                         The crowds fleeced of their living flesh at the far bank
                 The intubated children with their gas masks
                         Hanging from their hands and wandering
      The sand in wet hospital gowns in this their new cancer
                 Wasn’t this paradise
                        A boy headphoned and heart drunk
          Swaying at the back of the crowd mumbling to himself                        Started from the bottom now we’re here
     Started from the bottom now my whole team is fucking here
