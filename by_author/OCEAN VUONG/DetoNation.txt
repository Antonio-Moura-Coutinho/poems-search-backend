Look how lighterthe earth is — afterward.To even write the word fatheris to carve a portion of the dayout of a bomb-bright page.There’s enough light to drown inbut never enough to enter the bones& stay. Don’t stay here, he said, my boybroken by the names of flowers. Don’t cryanymore. So I ran into the night.The night: my shadow growingtoward my father.
