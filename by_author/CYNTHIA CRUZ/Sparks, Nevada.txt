
In the middle of the night, fatherBrought me a falcon.By morning, it ripped the wire and flew the hillInto the highway.When they found me in that carMy sleeve stemmed in blood,I didn’t know what it wasI was trying to kill.I saw a craft of orphans steaming down the river.They were dressed in white and silent as a séance.It was then I spoke to the bird.Already God is shaking his black seedBack into me.
