
When we talk about when to tell the kids,we are so together, so concentrated.I mutter, “I feel like a killer.” “I’mthe killer”—taking my wrist—he says,holding it. He is sitting on the couch, the old indigo chintz around him, rich as a night sea with jellies, I am sitting on the floor. I look up at him,as if within some chamber of matedness,some dust I carry around me. Tonight,to breathe its Magellanic field is lesspainful, maybe because he is drinkinga wine grown where I was born—fog,eucalyptus, sempervirens—and I’msharing the glass with him. “Don’t catchmy cold,” he says, “—oh that’s right, you wantto catch my cold.” I should not have told him that,I tell him I will try to fall out of love with him, but I feel I will love himall my life. He says he loves meas the mother of our children, and new troupesof tears mount to the acrobat platformsof my ducts and do their burning leaps.Some of them jump straight sideways, and, for amoment, I imagine a flurryof tears like a whirra of knives thrownat a figure, to outline it—a heart’s spurt of rage. It glitters, in my vision, I nodto it, it is my hope.
