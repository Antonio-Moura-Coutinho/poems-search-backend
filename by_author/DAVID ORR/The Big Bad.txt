
At last we decoded the terminal message,Only to find the pattern we had expectedWas false — a false trail of false bread crumbsDesigned to leave pitfalls undetected.We found a new pattern. We found a handMoving pieces we had thought were onlyPart of  the board, and shifting them to vantage pointsWe had ignored. We rewrote the battle planAnd reconfigured the satellite arrayTo show our progress from the very beginning.The fault should be traceable — and hence correctable — And once we found it, we’d be winning.We found a new pattern. We followed its trackTo a forest beside an abandoned tunnelDiving wide as a boxcar into the rock.A stale breeze blew over rusting shovelsAnd all of our instruments confirmed a hit.We set a perimeter. We sent in a scout.From the interior, nothing looked back at us.No tracks indicated a force had come out.But we had a pattern. At dawn, we dispatchedA team of our best, our trackers and stone killers,To see if  the signals were finally a matchAnd if so, to counterattack. And now we wait.And now we wait. The tunnel gives nothing back.The trees are revealing the first signs of goldBut the air is unmoving. The air is still.It is quiet here, and getting cold.
