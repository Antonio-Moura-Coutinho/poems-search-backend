The fact of the harp swells into the air,Alien and familiar and entirely too large,An elephant lost in the suburbs,And opens with its cry a strange passageBetween the harp itself, the fragile harp,And the almost guilty knowledgeOf   the stroke of   luck that brought it hereAnd the care with which it must depart.
