Yet what discov’ry by expectant eyesOf foreign shores, could vision half the throneFull gained by her, whose power fully grownExceeds the conquerors of th’ uncharted skies?So would I be this woman whom the worldAvows its benefactor; nobler far,Than Sybil, Joan, Sappho, or Egypt’s queen.In the alembic forged her shafts and hurledAt pain, diseases, waging a humane war;Greater than this achievement, none, I ween.
