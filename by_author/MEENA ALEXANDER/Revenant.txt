
This disease has come backWith frills and furbelows.You must give your whole life to poetryOnly a few survive if that—
Poems I mean, paper crumpledShades of another water—
Far springs are what you long for,Listening for the slow drip of chemicals
Through a hole in your chest.If you were torn from meI could not bear what the earth had to offer.
