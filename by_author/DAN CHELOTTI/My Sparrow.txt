It would be easyTo dismiss this view as beautiful and walk awayBecause it is buggy and we forgotThe spray, to cancel the conversationBecause its ease is perilous with conjunctions,To not touch because the sky would Separate from the sky and the mothershipWould fall through with a bannerWaving in a language we wouldn’tUnderstand though the meaning isAs clear as these intercontinentalContrails hatching mackerel skySaying we are full we are full Of sound and fury, we are signifyingNothing. Damned universal law.Damned categorical imperativeElbowing its way between my handsAnd your face. The sparrows againExploding against windowsAs a circle of men sitting outsideThe cafe while away their intentionsWith invisible motor tics they can’tEven feel unless the right empire of light Covers every last inch of themAnd brings to the surface the names — Those loves they choseTo stable. And there it is:The choice — if only the metaphorWere more complex if I could onlyAdverb away my existenceAnd say what a remarkable SundayThis is a perfect Sunday And turn my breath to stone.I’ve done it before, I spokeThe language of sweating cavern wallsAnd electric light. But I won’t go there again.We are all and only our distancesAnd when we touch that is what we touch.Our messy shelves. Our sullen privationsAnd overabundance of lemons.Our grief, our mountains and fieldsAnd rivers of grief. Our dismissalsAnd the love we ignore when we don’t runAfter the sparrows because the sparrowsWill fly away. My sparrow, fly away if you have toBut know that I am coming.I am low in the grass. I am burningWith patience. I am every song.I know all the math in the shoreSays you shouldn’t but my distance Is yours if you want it. And it is yoursIf you don’t. Dandelions and honeysuckleSurround me, the world’s ineluctable fireIs looking right at me, and I am making my stand.
