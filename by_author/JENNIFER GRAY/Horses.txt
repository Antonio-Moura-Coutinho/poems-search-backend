
The neighborâ€™s horses idleunder the roofof their three-sided shelter,looking out at the rain.Sometimesone or anotherwill fade into the shadowsin the corner, maybeto eat, or drink.Still, the others stand,blowing out their warmbreaths. Rain rattleson the metal roof.Their hoof printsin the corralopen gray eyes to the sky,and wink each timeanother drop falls in.
