You promised me nothingBut blamed me for doubting when who wouldn’t.If  I knew how to please you — who have found Out my faults. In dreams I’m wild with guilt. Have pityKill it. Then, when I’ve lost all hope,Kiss me again, your mouth so open — I’d give anything for one more night — That I go without thought. Don’t bite. No,Mark me. My husband already knowsExactly what owns me.
