
It’s a motley lot. A few still standat attention like sentries at the endsof their driveways, but more leanaskance as if they’d just received a blowto the head, and in fact they’ve receivedmany, all winter, from jets of wet snowshooting off the curved, tapered bladeof the plow. Some look wobbly, cockedat oddball angles or slumping forlornlyon precariously listing posts. One boxbows steeply forward, as if in disgrace, its door lolling sideways, unhinged. Others are dented, battered, streaked with rust, bandaged in duct tape,crisscrossed with clothesline or bungee cords.A few lie abashed in remnants of the very snow that knocked them from their perches.Another is wedged in the crook of a treelike a birdhouse, its post shattered nearby.I almost feel sorry for them, worn outby the long winter, off-kilter, not knowingwhat hit them, trying to hold themselvestogether, as they wait for news from spring.
