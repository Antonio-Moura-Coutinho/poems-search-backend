
For the second time this weekI've watched snow fall at sunrise,dawn arrive on a breeze(the way I think it always does).I don't know which, time or the weather,woke me, charmed me out of a dreamwhere a few of us floated around,gravity's jokers,face-up in the quiet waterand the jetsam of a slow life.I had one line that I'd savedand let it go as though it were mine,calling for “Darker days and brighter gods!” Then I only had my waking instant,but it opened with that same shadowless light,a sense of change, of something both nearand remote, first and last,blowing with the wind and snowthrough my reflection in the window.And then I lost it.So here I am, with cigarettes and cold coffee,an unfinished ode to idleness,cobwebs in high places,a spider that rappels down the bookshelves,and a commotion recollected in tranquility;sunlight pouring through,and another bright pagewith a peculiar darkness flowing over it
—shadows of heatwaves from the radiator,or my thoughts going up in smoke.The glass, when misted over,reminds me of store windows,how they're swathed with soap,shrouded in secrecybefore a grand openingor after an ignominious closing.Either way, not very interestingexcept, perhaps, when the grafitti,the anonymous messages appearscrawled across themby some child of the air,words you can see throughor a clear smear.And at twilight I'm still here,the same place, the same light.Nothing to do but move with the view:snow, wind over soft ruins,unfinished buildings that loomlike monuments to a spent curiosity.I'm in the tallest, up here with the Nopesroosting on soggy flunkgirders.Want a cigarette? Nope.Got a match? Nope.See any alternative to solipsism? Nope.Hedonism? Nope. Sloppy stoicism? Nope.Did you know that Marylandhas no natural but only man-made lakes? Nope.The creatures of idlenessare pure speculation.They follow the weather,shadow the wind, fill in the blanks.Some are big and clumsy and slyand like to lick my watch;others, like gerunds,have already drunk themselvesinto a state of being.Another, with time on his handsand the sense of how windowsare both inside and outside a place,stands there watching his silhouettechange to a reflectionas the light shiftsand he moves forward or back,plays like a godstepping in and out of himself,and hears the wind as the breath of changewhen the last flurry whirls away in the light. The last flake grows larger
