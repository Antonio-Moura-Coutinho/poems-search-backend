The year and its
    as like as eggs,
        the days
in their crates of season
    we break open
        and the yolk
of fresh sun we scramble
    the runny light into
        a firm
break
    of the night's winter
        helping of the fast.
                      *
Yellow dishes—
        forsythia
    set out for the early
            meal of season—
sit the house    yards
        the town
    parks    down together
            to this spring as
to a table
        all set
    in order    just
            So
good to see
        you and
    your way found
            back.
​                      *
The arriving coats of smell
    are hung in the air, butt-smacked and
        oiled babies of moment;
and years of taste as touch
    hug    the senses
        to the living;
sweet sour bitter salty
    some never experienced
        again, the gloved fingers
of bananas    so briefly kissed
    with ripeness; fruit,
        grip-shaped thought
brought to the tongue,
    the finished taste
        of words,    an aftertaste
of silence,    the morning
    glories we haven't tasted
        yet
​                      *
life, as lasting as any one
    sense, a taste
        a sight, an orange mix
of kiss with sweetness
    for the moment
        it exists, finishes and
is swallowed, is also those
    who finish hungry or starve
        to death    which swallows;
the final stage of rattlesnake bite
    is yellow vision,
        light,    then you both go out.
Fear, to the tongue, is metallic: I tasted
    a copper penny    it could have been
        a one-time and final, incomparable
        —How does life taste
        to one condemned
            in that cup    this morning?—
