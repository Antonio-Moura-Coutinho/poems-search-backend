
I’m going to look at my watch
though I don’t really care what time it is.
Just slightly curious.
It’s funny when you see
it’s much earlier or later
than you thought,
but even funnier when it’s exactly
the time you thought.
But at my back etc.Etc. being
“Desarts of vast Eternity.”
I give up.
It’s eleven eleven.
What ever happens
at eleven eleven?
Vast eternity!
