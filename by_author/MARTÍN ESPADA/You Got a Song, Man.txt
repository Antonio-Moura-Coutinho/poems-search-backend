You told me the son of Acton’s town nurse   
would never cross the border   
into Concord, where the Revolution   
left great houses standing on Main Street.   
Yet we crossed into Concord, walking   
through Sleepy Hollow Cemetery   
to greet Thoreau, his stone   
stamped with the word Henry
jutting like a gray thumbnail   
down the path from Emerson   
and his boulder of granite.   
We remembered Henry’s night in jail,   
refusing tax for the Mexican War,   
and I could see you hunched with him,   
loaning Henry a cigarette, explaining
the perpetual wink of your eye   
lost after the windshield   
burst in your boyhood face.   
When Emerson arrived
to ask what you and Henry
were doing in there, you would say:You got a song, man, sing it.   
You got a bell, man, ring it.
