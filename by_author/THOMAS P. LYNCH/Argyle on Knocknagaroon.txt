
Because he barely heard the voice of Godabove the hum of other choristers—batwing and bird-whistle, gathering thunder,the hiss of tides retreating, children, cattle;because he could not readily discernthe plan Whoever Is In Charge Here has,he wondered about those who claimed to haveblessed assurances or certainty:a One and Only Way and Truth and Life,as if Whatever Breathes in Everything  mightn’t speak in every wondrous tongue;as if, of all creations, only onemade any sense. It made no sense to him.  Hunger he understood, touch, desire.  He knew the tenderness humans could do,no less brutalities.  He knew the coldmorning, the broad meadow, the gold sunset.One evening on the hill of Knocknagaroon,the Atlantic on one side, the Shannon on the other, the narrowing headlandsof the peninsula out behind him,the broad green palm of Moveen before him,it seemed he occupied the hand of God:open, upturned, outstretched, uplifting him.
