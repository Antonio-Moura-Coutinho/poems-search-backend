
Once there was a man who filmed his vacation. He went flying down the river in his boatwith his video camera to his eye, makinga moving picture of the moving riverupon which his sleek boat moved swiftly toward the end of his vacation. He showedhis vacation to his camera, which pictured it, preserving it forever: the river, the trees,the sky, the light, the bow of his rushing boat behind which he stood with his camera preserving his vacation even as he was having it so that after he had had it he would stillhave it. It would be there. With a flickof a switch, there it would be. But hewould not be in it. He would never be in it.
