
I am not land or timber
nor are you
ocean or celestial body,
but rather we are
the small animals
we have always been.
The land and the sea
know each other
at the threshold
where they meet,
as we know something
of one another,
having shown,
at different times,
some bit of flesh,
some feeling.
We call the showingknowing instead of practice.
We seem to say,
at different times,A feeling comes.
What is the metaphor
for two animals
sharing the same space?Marriage?
We share a practice,
you and I,
a series of postures.
Here is how I
become a tree
[                            ]
and you
[                            ]
a body in space.
