It needs a regime!I need a drink. My car and my skin need a drink. I want to sayain’t you a cool glass of water. My skin is so dulland I have no car. My eyes, however, are ritzy.I favor the non-abrasive. My cult productis an anti-aging self-emollient. More oftenthis is new pajamas. But pajamas need multi-talents!I’m not yet old-old. Thinking of crystal decantersmakes me feel young, they are inscrutable adulthood.My skin can’t be so bad — sleep is like a drinkand my controls are set to bed. This is my mitigationagainst stress, stern weather, assorted irritations.Being ravaged is my own fault! Proper livingrequires routine, tiny adjustments that make life better.I’m making plans with no muscle to them.Sleep is no artificial skin, despite its gauzy potential.Rose water — by the by I’d rather drink itas the hokey pendulum swings.I’m looking for something foolproof, aplombthat withstands the interrogating nude.
