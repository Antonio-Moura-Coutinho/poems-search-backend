If you bomb
the IND
or tag the 2
downtown
—gallery-bound—
dousing it in tribal
shrapnel, you're it

If you can lie
between the rails
—Please Stand
Clear the Closing—
or press yourselves
betw. train
& the wall
spray can rattling
like a tooth—The roof
the roof
the roof is on
fire
