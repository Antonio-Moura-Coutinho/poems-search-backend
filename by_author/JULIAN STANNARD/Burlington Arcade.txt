
I’m being carried downthe Burlington Arcadeby Beadles in top hats,jewelers on both sidesholding out their handsand wrapped in cashmere.When people speak ofnear-death experiencesthey’re always going throughtunnels, they’re happy,they’re never going throughthe Burlington Arcade.Eric says, It’s goodto see you wearing clothesand I have to admit he’swearing the most beautifultrousers and I say, Ericyou’re not supposed to bein this poem. Get backinto your shop! I can seea light at the end of the tunnel.The Head Beadle’s saying“Burlington Gardens!”Should I tip him?Am I dead?What happens next?
