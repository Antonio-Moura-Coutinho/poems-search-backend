
I remember a performanceof Antigone in which shethrew herself on the floor ofthe universe and picked upa piece of dust. Is thatthe particle? It startled me.Was it Scripted? Directed?Driven? I am a girl, Antigone.I have a sister. We loveeach other terribly. I am a womanof property. The milk of the footlights.The folds of the curtain. I remembera performance of Antigone. She stooped.There was a wild particle.It was glorified by my distance.I heard the hooves of the dust.The ticking of the scriptcalibrating oblivion. I sawthe particle hangingand Antigone needed somethingto do with her handsand she did it.
