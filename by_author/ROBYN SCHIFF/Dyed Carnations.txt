
There’s blue, and then there’s blue.A number, not a hue, this blueis not the undertone of any onebut there it is, primary.I held the bouquetin shock and cut the stems at a deadly angle.I opened the toxic sachet of flower foodwith my canine and rinsed my mouth.I used to wash my hands and daydream.I dreamed of myself and washedmy hands of everything. Easy math.Now I can’t get their procedureat the florist off my mind.The white flowers arrived! They overnightedin a chemical bathand now they have a fake laughthat catches like a matchthat starts the kind of kitchen firethat is fanned by water.They won’t even look at me.Happy Anniversary.
