The sprig of unknown bloom you sent last fallspent the long winter drying on my wall,mounted on black. But it had turned to fluffsome months ago. Tonight I took it downbecause I thought that I had had enoughof staring at it. Brittle, dry and brown,it seemed to speak too plainly of a wasteof friendship, forced to flower, culled in haste.So, after months of fearing to walk pastin case the stir should scatter it to bits,I took it out to scatter it at lastwith my own breath, and so to call us quits.
