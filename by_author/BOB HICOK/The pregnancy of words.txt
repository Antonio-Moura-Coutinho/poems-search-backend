Which is smitefor you violet types, a flowerthat says “love it” if you listen. Me, I doand don’t feel it matters that evil thrivesin live, that we tinker and smasheverything down to bits and thentry to patch a path back home, it’s our lottoin life, to have no cluewhat a natural disaster iswhen that disaster is us. That’s what I loveabout the shrug, it says zilchsans le mouth and becomesmore aerobic the more you admitthe less you know, you know? It’s a jumbleout there, kids, with slips and slidesand elide’s eally ool, dependingwhat’s lopped off, as in light of   handor slight of and, but I better spotbefore you pots how sparsethis parsing is. Besides, what can I sayabout language other than it’s an anal eggin need of one glorious u. Wordsor sword — pick your poisson. Every timeI try to peak into speaking, the bagof gab to learn what our noodlesare really up to, I get flummoxedthat the tools I useare the stool I stand onto see a way in or out. I can’t even tellif  I’m more trapped or rapt,if meaning’s mean or play’sa dumb waiter riding numblyup and down. But have you noticedread becomes dearif you ignore the worldas you find it and find it in youto swirl the word, in the waysolve and loves are the samebones, different skeletons.
