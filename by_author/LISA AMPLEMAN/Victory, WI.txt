We are invulnerableto their spectral lead, descendants of fur traders (beaver, ermine,skunk). Our lungs are clean and pink. Letâ€™s visitthe saw shop, the greenhouse with bluff views,the pines and stacks of firewood,the Blackhawk general store, named forthe warrior who waved a chalky,misunderstood flag and eluded capturefor weeks. In winter, eaglesdive here, gathering lift when the windhits the bluffs: all hail the migratingraptor, its piercing talon and yellow cere.
