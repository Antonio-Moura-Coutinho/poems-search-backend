
If someone tells you that your poem is nostalgic,
take it as a compliment. There's no greater
praise. In Greek, nostos means "return" andalgia "pain." What's a poem without the return
of pain?  If they tell you that your poem is
melancholic, take that as a compliment, too. In
Greek, melan means "black" and khole "bile."
What's a poem without the most pernicious disorder
of the body and soul?  Pain and illness.  If your
poem is nostalgic and melancholic, see a doctor.
