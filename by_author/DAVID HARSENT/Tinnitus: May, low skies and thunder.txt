
Rough music in the lane,the love child lapped in bloodand safe at her breast, the painechoed in wood on wood,steel on steel, as they come,the women in their blacks,to hound her from house and home,bands of bitches and claquesof crones with their pots and pans,their hooks and ladles and bowls,to beat outside in the street,to stand at her window and howl,while the child takes a taste of greenmilk and “the dead of night”is all she has of her ownand the music goes on and on.
