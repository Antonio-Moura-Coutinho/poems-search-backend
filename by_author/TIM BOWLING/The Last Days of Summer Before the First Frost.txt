
Here at the wolf’s throat, at the egress of the howl,all along the avenue of deer-blink and salmon-kickwhere the spider lets its microphone downinto the cave of the blackberry bush—earth echo,absence of the human voice—wait herewith a bee on your wrist and a fly on your cheek,the tiny sun and tiny eclipse.It is time to be grateful for the breathof what you could crush without thought,a moth, a child’s love, your own life.There might never be another chance.How did you find me, the astonished mother saysto her four-year-old boy who’d disappearedin the crowds at the music festival.I followed my heart, he shrugs,so matter-of-fact you might not seebehind his words(o hover and feed, but not too long)the bee trails turning to ice as they’re flown.
