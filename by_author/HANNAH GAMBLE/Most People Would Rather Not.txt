
Most people would rather not,but I indulge, every few weeks,the thought of it. Sometimesthe oily smell of an evening flower appearsand hangs in the air, a slightly browner spot.I think most people had it wrong when they saidforget about it and find a fresh patch  of  grass to lie down in.  There are prayers, though,about that kind of peace.  I have to admit, sometimesI want nothing more than to be lying on the bottomof an unimpressive river.  I can watch all the leaves and sticks skim over my head,and no one will bother me  because they’re swimmingin the more impressive rivers.The water’s not too cold. It doesn’t feellike being dead.It also doesn’t feel like being oldor fetal.I came to the humble water to lie down.I did what I set out to do.Now I don’t have to tell youanything more about it.
