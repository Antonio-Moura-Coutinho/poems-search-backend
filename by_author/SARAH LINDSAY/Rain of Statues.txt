Our general was elsewhere, but we drowned.While he rested, he shipped us homewith the bulk of  his spoilsthat had weighed his army down.The thrashing stormthat caught us cracked the hullsand made us offerings to the sea floor — a rain of statues, gold, and men.Released from service,done with war,the crash and hiss muted,we fell through streams of creatureswhose lives were their purpose.We settled with treasure lootedfrom temples of rubbled Athenian Greece;among us, bronze and marble gods and goddessesmoored without grace,dodged by incurious fish.Their power was never meant to buoy us — our pleasures were incidental gifts — but, shaken by their radiance in our dust,we had given them our voices.Their faces, wings, and limbslie here with our sanded bonesand motionless devices. Little crabs attempt to don ringsset with agate and amethyst,and many an octopus,seeking an hour of rest,finds shelter in our brain-cases.So we are still of use.
