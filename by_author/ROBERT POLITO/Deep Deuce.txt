
As phantoms direct life from the shadows,
 
                                                                              I feel
I leaned on something,
                                          and it broke.
 
My father on the porch with his crosswords said,
this must be what it feels like to be dead;
 
When I returned from the dead there was no one to greet me,
but still you are glad—
 
I wander the ruins the way my tongue
wanders my missing teeth,
the bricks and mortar of Deep Deuce
rotted like molars in an ancient mouth;
 
Here Charlie Christian might have walked—
 
The astrologer counseled patience
and creative imaging:
                                  Step One: Visualizean object that symbolizes the accursed influence. Picture yourself throwing it into a furnace.                                  Step two: Visualizethe person who is responsible for the curse. Imagine one end of a ropeis tied around your waist and the other around that person. Picture yourself cuttingthe rope with a chainsaw as you call out, “You have no power over me!”                                  Step three: Repeattwice a day for eleven days . . .
 
You visualize her green boots inside the furnace . . .
 
—No. You are in a crematorium and you see
her perfect and corruptible body on a tray sliding into fire;
 
Then you see yourself cutting the rope that ties you together with a saw;
 
And then at last your own imperfect and corruptible body—I mean, me—calls out
 
and I jump in after her.
