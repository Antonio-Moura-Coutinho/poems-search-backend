A weed tree?Branches screen buildings, subway tracks,his patch of yard. We disagree,claim back the sap, heartwood, wild bark.He declares the tree “hazardous.”We shelter under leaf-hoard, crosswayfor squirrels, branch house for sparrows, jays.The balcony soaks up the shade.Chatter-song drowns out cars below.Sun branches down. Leaves overwhelm.The tree will stay. We tell him “no.”Root deep through pavement, Elm.
