The milkmaids say Pray for their speech is reserved,fixed here in circles of opalized light.
Presenting themselves without fancy or choicechapped hands on the full udder’s verge,
y’know — cream-skinned, gathering toad spume on skirtsrelentlessly cracking the snails underfoot —
a century later & more their compeers bow headsto these luminous fields made of ether,
of blue & extravagant air, calling up with the samenimble fingers their ciphered familiars,
girl-souls at large in a nonhuman hour.Speaking their argot & screen-practiced moue.
Not to you, with your paper, your man-heavy shoes,untouched by the mulch of the digital yard!
They only gaze rapt at threshold, milk spilled.No purchase for you here, Sir, & no clue —
