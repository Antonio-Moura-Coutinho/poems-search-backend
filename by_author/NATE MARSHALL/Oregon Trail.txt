my first venture west was in Windows 98or Independence, Missouri. class in the computer lab& we were supposed to be playing some typing gameor another. the one i remember had a haunted theme.ghosts instructing us on the finer points of where to put our fingers. these were the last days before keyboards as appendage, when typing was not nature. i should’ve been letting an apparition coach me through QWERTY but rather i was at the general store deciding between ammo & axles,considering the merits of being a banker or carpenter.too young to know what profession would get me to the Willamette Valley in the space of a 40-minute period. i aimed my rifle with the arrow keys, tapped the spacebar with a prayer for meat to haul back to the wagon.this game came difficult as breathing underwater aftertrying to ford a river.                                         i was no good at survival.somebody always fell ill or out into the river.each new day scurvy or a raid was the fate of a characternamed for my crush or my baby sister.this loss i know, how to measure what it meansto die premature before a school period ends.i can’t understand the game coming to a late end. an elderly daughter grieving her elderly mother. reading the expansive obit in a suburban Detroit church is a confusing newness.when the old do the thing the world expectsi retreat into my former self. focus on beatingvideo games I’ve always sucked at, brush upon Chicago Bulls history, re-memorizethe Backstreet Boys catalog, push away whatever woman is foolhardy enough to be on any road with me. i pioneer my way awayfrom all the known world. i look at homicide rates & wish we all expired the way i know best. i prayfor a senseless, poetic departure. i pray for my familyto not be around to miss me while i’m still here.i want a short obituary, a life brief & unfulfilled,the introductory melody before a beat’s crescendo into song,the game over somewhere in the Great Plains.i want to spare my descendants the confusionof watching a flame flicker slow. keep them from beingat a funeral thumbing the faded family pictures like worn keys,observing the journey done, the game won, the westconquered.
