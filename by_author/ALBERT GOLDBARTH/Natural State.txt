What’smost delightful is that Tristan, eleven, and Aidan, ten,are reading, each of them enmazed in a fantasy novelthat squeezes them by the attention-bone behind the eyesin its thimble pool of pineal juice and drizzled endorphins.Tristan cared enough to cry when he finished his previous bookand its battle of shadow and radiance was over.Each of us: his individual book; and yetthe silence is communal. This is a natural stateat Nathan’s. Holly, however, is reading the Sunday paperand so serves, without saying a word, to remind ushow natural it was for Raeshawn Nelson, seven,to fall while running and burn out his eyeon the disregarded meth pipe, or for Anna Rietta, nine,to have come home from school and excitedly been the **!star!**, each day, of the homemade porn her parentspeddled as “young fun” over the Internet. Thiswas what they knew, and all they knew, and so they entered itas comfortably as Tristan does his opened worldof sorcerors and valiant knights and fancy-talking beasts, since usex frequency = familiarity. That’s the strict, imperious mathof everybody’s insular subuniverse. Sherena asked me whatthis thing “vermouth” was (she pronounced it “mouth”) and orderedquiche as if it were the brother of “touché”; but thenshe needed to explain to me why C-C was the “bottom bitch”and what a “T-girl” is and how to put down moneyon Ice’s book at “the county,” by whichshe meant jail. And those years when Darwin parsedthe slimy fiber of his barnacles (discovering the specieswhere “the female has no anus” and the one with “tiny parasiticmales [that were] embedded in one female’s flesh like blackheads”),“squinty . . . laborious,” were among the final decades of hundreds of yearswhen a woman in China would suffer ritual foot binding,at five, the bandages limiting growth until the toeswere bent and curled (the toenails growing into the balls of the feet)and the arches broken. This resulted in the desirable“shrunken plums” and “three-inch golden lilies” soughtby marriage brokers. Traditionally, a prospective mother-in-lawwould check below the hem, and reject any feetover four inches long. Entire generations of women could only mince and hobble. And this was natural, this was the airand the light and “the-way-of-things-forever” thatyou woke up to every day . . . as natural as the implicit lawsin Aidan’s book, by which a bear converseswith a girl in growly mutual-speak, and a boyof sturdy heart and his wingéd horse ascendtheir sky with the unremarkable grace of birdsin ours. That’s ordinary Newtonian physics there, and Aidansubjects himself to the rules of flying horsemanship,and the code of those of innocent spiritabout to war with wyverns and the wormfolk, andthe governing instructions of gods with the headsof wide-eyed animals . . . and even now, Sherena textsmy phone to say that WEATHER GOOD and SHINEGOT BULLET IN LUNG FROM POLICE
