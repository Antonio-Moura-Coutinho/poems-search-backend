
I. The Day Dreamers
All day all over the city every person
Wanders a different city, sealed intact
And haunted as the abandoned subway stations   
Under the city. Where is my alley doorway?
Stone gable, brick escarpment, cliffs of crystal.   
Where is my terraced street above the harbor,   
Café and hidden workshop, house of love?
Webbed vault, tiled blackness. Where is my park, the path
Through conifers, my iron bench, a shiver   
Of ivy and margin birch above the traffic?   
A voice. There is a mountain and a wood
Between us—
