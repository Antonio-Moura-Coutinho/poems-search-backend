Three moons in the skythe night they found himdrowned in Sawtan’s Bog;just his cap, sitting thereand his wee fat hands poking out.It was no loss to the village, I told them next morning,and the villagers agreed. Horn-daft, he was,havering and glaikitand scaring the children.I mind that timehe picked up a mouseand ate it, quick, in two mouthfuls;set the tail asideon the groundlike a cocktail stick.I used her well, after that,his Jennie,still in her widow’s weeds,gilping into herwhenever I could,in the barn or the boathouseor off in the fields.She slipped two or three out at least,and sank each one in a lobster creel.Her head was awayby the end, as mad as her manand no good to me.She sleeps now under Beinn Ruadhainn, her face covered in ivy, scab, and sticky-willow.The dreams came then.Last night, the burning loch, so full of bairnsthey bobbed to the surface with their hair on fire;black snow; fingers coming through the floorboards;rain like razor blades;the foosty-faced man, there at every corner,hands furred with grey-mould.And her, as always, star-naked, hatchingin the herring-nets.The last I remember was my body being drivenwith sticks through the townto Sawtan’s Brae, and hanged.I broke from sleep and sat up sweating, dream-fleyed in the dark.I groped around for the matchesand the matches were put in my hand.
