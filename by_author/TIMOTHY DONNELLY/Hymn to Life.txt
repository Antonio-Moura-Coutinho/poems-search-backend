There were no stout-legged llamas, stilt-legged llamas, no single Yukon horse. The lastof the teratorns, its wingspan broader than the room inwhich I’m writing now, had long since landed on a tar pit’ssurface and was lost. There might be other things to think ofstrobing in the fume or sometimes poking through the thick of itlike the tiny golden toads once so prevalent in the cloudforests north of Monteverde, only none of them were livinganywhere anymore. The last was seen on May 15, 1989, the weekBon Jovi’s “I’ll Be There for You” topped Billboard’s Hot 100.Then it dropped to three. A teratorn might have fit in herethe long way come to think of it. A study claims it wasn’tclimate change that killed the golden toad but a fungal epidemicprovoked by cyclical weather patterns. Little things like thathad a way of disappearing: thimbles, the Rocky Mountaingrasshopper, half the hearing in my patient ear. There wereno Eastern elk, no sea mink, and no heath hens, a distinctsubspecies of the prairie chicken. Once common to the coastalbarrens of New Hampshire down to Virginia, they’re often thoughtto have been eaten in favor of wild turkey at the inauguralThanksgiving feast. To work on my character I pretend to betraveling Portsmouth to Arlington in modern garb at first,then backwards into costumes of the past: tee shirt and shorts,gray flannel suit, a cutaway jacket and matching breechestucked into boots, taupe velvet getup with ruffles and ribbonsstreaming into Delaware till I’m buckled like a Puritan, musketin hand, not half-famished, and there’s plenty of heath henseverywhere I look. But there were still no Carolina parakeetsand no Smith Island cottontails, a long contested subspeciesof the Eastern cottontail. These lost rabbits, somewhat shaggierthan their mainland cousins, were named for the barrierisland off the tip of Virginia’s Eastern Shore, where Thomas Dale,deputy governor of the Virginia Colony, set up a salt worksback in 1614, and not for the Chesapeake’s other Smith Islandup in Maryland, birthplace of the Smith Island cake, that state’sonly official dessert — a venerable confection whose pencil-thin layers, numbering eight to twelve on average, lie dividedby a fudge-like frosting cooked for greater lastingness, making itsuitable for local oystermen to take with them on the longautumn harvest. Smith Island in Washington offers nestingsites for tufted puffins on its rocky cliff faces as well as reststations for migrant sea lions. Situated in Long Island Sound, Connecticut’s Smith Island is among that state’s famed ThimbleIslands, a cluster of landmasses named for the thimbleberry,cousin to the black raspberry. During the Revolutionary War,the Thimbles were deforested to rid the sound of hidingplaces for British ships. Alabama boasts no fewer than threeSmith Islands. Little can be said about the one in Minnesota’sVoyageurs National Park. Its neighboring islands includeRabbit, Snake, Wolf, Wigwam, Sweetnose, and Twin Alligatordown here on the American side, and Little Dry, Big, and Big Dryup on the Canadian. Tomorrow should be 82° and sunnybut it won’t be. The blue pike cavorted through the watersof the Great Lakes no longer. Ditto the somber blackfin cisco.Overfishing, pollution, and the introduction of nonnativespecies did both fish in as early as 1960 and ’70, respectively.There were no spectacled cormorants, no Goff’s pocket gophers, and no Ainsworth’s salamanders, a species known to us onlythrough two specimens found on Ainsworth family propertyin Mississippi on June 12, 1964. That same day Nelson Mandelawas sentenced to life in prison. I remember the feeling ofanother kind, the way they alternately lay limp in my handsthen pleaded to be free. They took naps in the dampness of softened logs. There’s a fine dirt, a dust I guess, that collectsunder the rug I’m sitting on. I think the rough weave of itacts as rasp to our foot-bottoms then sieve to what it loosens.There were no Caribbean monk seals, eight of which no lessthan Christopher Columbus killed for food in 1494, and thereforeno Caribbean monk seal nasal mites, an objectively hideousarachnoid parasite that resided nowhere but in the respiratorypassages of the Monachus tropicalis. When it occurs to me Isweep it up. Back in the day they used to darken our skiesin flocks a mile wide and 300 miles in length, enough to featherthe air from Fall River down to Philadelphia, their peakpopulation hovering above five billion, or 40% of the totalroll of  birds in North America, but there were no remainingpassenger pigeons, the last of their red eyes having shutin Cincinnati on September 1, 1914. Her name was Martha.Martha Washington went by Patsy as a child. Her pet raccoonwas Nosey. Cozumel Island’s pygmy raccoon is actually a distinctspecies and not, like the Barbados raccoon, a subspeciesof the common. There might be as few as 250 of the formerhidden in the mangroves or prowling the wetlands for ghostcrabs and lizards, whereas the latter was last seen in ’64when one was struck dead by a car in Bathsheba, a fishing villagebuilt on Barbados’s eastern shore, magnet for hurricanesand pro surfers, its foamy white waters calling to mindthe milk baths rumored to have kept Solomon’s mother soperilously beautiful. First the milk’s lactic acid would haveacted as an exfoliant, gently removing layers of the dead,dry skin to uncover younger, fresher skin waiting like artworkin Dunkirk underneath, then the milk’s natural fat contentwould restore moisture lost to the exacting atmosphereof biblical Jerusalem, whose name in Hebrew, yireh shalem,means “will see peace.” Most versions of the story make herinto an exhibitionist but the Midrash says Bathsheba, modest,was washing behind a wicker screen when Satan, seizingopportunity, appeared as a red bird to David who, cocksurewith projectiles now, aimed the stone in his hands at the birdbut hit the screen instead, splitting it in half and therebyrevealing our bather, the wife of Uriah the Hittite at the timebut not for much longer. All these gains and losses, so mysteriousfrom a distance, held together it has felt by nothing strongerthan momentum, like a series of bicycle accidents or a patternin the pomegranate, come to hint at a logic in time, but whetherit’s more fitting to say that they promise to reveal it or elsethreaten to is debatable. Attempts to stem the vast mosquitopopulation in salt marshes abutting Kennedy Space Centeron Florida’s Merritt Island, technically a peninsula but more likea question mark of land flopped into the Atlantic, devastatedthe dusky seaside sparrow. Its last known specimen diedon June 17, 1987, when the ballad “Always” by Atlantic Starrdominated radio. Mosquitoes would have taken to the nastyOlduvai water hole around which two clans of hominids battleat the start of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is afterthe first monolith shows up. The film’s monoliths are artifactsof alien origin, identical in ratio but varying in size, designedto provoke large-scale changes in human life. As when it dawnson the wiry leader of the clan the first monolith appears toto bludgeon the other to death with a leg bone. Later on he hurls itinto the air to celebrate his power, the image of its tumblingweaponhood at half-speed match-cutting to that of a longwhite nuclear satellite angled in orbit against the scintillantanthracite of space. Pan right to the Earth, a quarter of it silveryblue in the corner, aloofly beautiful for sure but only a paleidea of a planet when set beside photographs taken years laterby the crew of Apollo 17 on December 7, 1972, annus finalisfor the Lake Pedder earthworm, bush wren, and possiblythe Toolache wallaby as well, long considered among kangaroosto have been the most elegant. The sapphire blue, the ochreof Africa, the chalk-white spirals convolving as if an ice cap’s wispy tentacles. They were killed for fur, sport, and frequentlywith the aid of greyhounds, who hunt mostly by way of sightas opposed to scent. Then the Earth is at the left as the satelliteapproaches it almost dozily to the opening bars of Strauss’sBlue Danube, first performed on February 15, 1867, in the nowdefunct Diana Ballroom. In my own Diana Ballroom, namednot for the Roman goddess of the hunt, the moon, and chastitydirectly, but by way of the two-kilometer lunar crater christenedin her honor in 1979, declivity in whose embrace my ballroomtrembles comfortably, I boost my chi by remembering to breathedeep, to eat oatmeal, ginger, and figs, and to commit myselfto a custody of wildflowers, up to and including the maroonperfume of the chocolate cosmos, a non-self-pollinating specieswhose every plant now in bloom is a clone of the selfsamespecimen uprooted from a cubic foot of Mexico back in 1902.Likewise the last known Rocky Mountain locust ever to appearappeared alone that year on a prairie up in Canada, whereasdecades before a glistering storm of them blanketed an areavast as California, matter-of-factly devouring buckwheat, barley,strawberries, apple trees, fence posts, and even the laundrywildly flapping away on the line, the sound of “millions of jawsbiting and chewing” setting a nation’s nerves on edge, or at leastLaura Ingalls Wilder’s, if we’re to believe her On the Banksof Plum Creek
