
Oblong, its jutted ends rounding into circles,The old sunken basin lies with its flat, marble lipAn inch below the terrace tiles.Over the stagnant waterSlide reflections:The blue-green of coned yews;The purple and red of trailing fuchsiasDripping out of marble urns;Bright squares of skyRibbed by the wake of a swimming beetle.Through the blue-bronze waterWavers the pale uncertainty of a shadow.An arm flashes through the reflections,A breast is outlined with leaves.Outstretched in the quiet waterThe statue of a Goddess slumbers. But when Autumn comesThe beech leaves cover her with a golden counter-pane.
