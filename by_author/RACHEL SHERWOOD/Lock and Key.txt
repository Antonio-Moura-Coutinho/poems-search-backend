
I hardly know where to look
anymore. Places have a
putrid familiarity
like the smell of my own sheets
or the close air of the kitchen â€”
fishbones on the drain
left in the ghastly order
of temporal things.I have been sitting in this barfor years nowthe beer is stale, the wine off-colorthe music is always the same,old, sad songs that get olderno better than endless conversationnight after forgotten nightwhen all I or you can recallis the dark, the traffic lights,the bartender's commentsabout drunk womenin public places.I would like to go homefinally, down the long streetsnorth and south crossed with small gold leaves;I forget just where the hellanything is. Locked out.
