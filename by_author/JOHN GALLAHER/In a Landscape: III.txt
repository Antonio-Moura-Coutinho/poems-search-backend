We can say we’re working on our age,as well, listening to Bob Dylan songs where people can agein whatever direction supports the theme. “Too bad life doesn’tget themes,” Robin says, and yes, that’s right, and then we can all go do whatever it was we were going to do anyway. “It’s either that,or pay off the kidnapper,” as Neil Young had it, back in the mid-70s.There’s always an analogue, and someone to tell us about it,how, no matter how fast you run, you can’t run fast enoughto get away from yourself. You could even call it a theme.For instance, I was the first one to an eighteen-wheeler accidenton the highway once, in the early 90s. I didn’t know whatI was going to find. It was just tossed there on its side, acrossboth lanes. So I got out of the car and walked around to the front,only to see the driver standing inside the cab that was restingon the driver-side door. He was simply standing there behind the glass,parallel with the dashboard, a little blood on his forehead, lookingas lost as I felt, looking back at him. All his things (magazinesand maps and cigarettes and pens and snacks) in a little pile at his feet.When I left, a guy was hitting the windshield with a baseball bat.You go to the room, and the place you like to sitis missing. This is an opportunity to trust, I suppose, or perhapsfor blind panic, if one were to consider this a metaphorfor something. But say it’s not, say there are no such thingsas metaphors for a moment, and where does that get you?Presently, it gets me to a row of green and yellow plastic chairs,those 1950s-looking ones I imagine Kenton would liketo collect. They’re joined together by shiny metal clasps, chrome,and the whole thing is full of sunlight through the plate glasswindow. It’s the kind of scene I think of as lickable, how everything looks like cheerful candy, and I wonder if there might be a wayto be there or here without a beginning, or without an ending,or if perhaps there might be a concept for no middle.
