Carefulnot to let it     speak too loudly.     Only humdemure     in polite company — never laughor spit on the sidewalk     or complain lest we both be dragged     under the wheels ofone of those.     Or worse     coddledsmiled at     as at a lapdog acting wolf.Or worse     called ugly     a cruel joke. Or — there are always     worse things.Too many messengers     shot.     But thenwho wouldn’t fear     an eyeless facewhose ghost stories     always     come true?
