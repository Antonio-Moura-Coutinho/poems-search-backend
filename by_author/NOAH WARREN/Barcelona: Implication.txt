We’ve all gouached.Haven’t we? Pollock lashedstretched canvas that was Nude.Was said to call his Ruth prudeand he spat chew in a coffee canand shat bloodily in the can.When I was twenty I spent threehours in a room with the Free-Spirited Types moving fromone inviting orifice to the welcomeof another. I was lost in my wood,savage and stern. But also I understoodthat when it was later and I was wiserI could never forgive Herr Pfizer.My father said we’ve all got an East River.He had a tenuous web of veins for a liver.His loss. Literally. Mom’s impatient artwas proved to be the most effective partof her mothering: you should see her rich greenswell up in the power of the middle and grow leanas they colonize the crusted edges.My love for her is impregnable.Pity Miró, moonblind, weary on the rocky coastof Portugal, walking cliff paths and getting lost.His quest for childish wonder has bent himand riddled his skin before its time.Put this together with that! Paint it yellow!Murk the sky with banks of Periwinkle and Snow.Gouache a widened eye low on the right,so it can behold the left and the night.
