A cell becomesa fetus becomes baby becomes you.Go do your homework.”She will wait for me to calm down,her eyes patient requiring the truthand I will tell her:“Babies come from Friday nights melted into Saturday mornings;the Isley Brothers and 3 or 4 glasses of white zin; miniskirtsand aching zippers; sofa cushions sweaty and  ogodthecondombroke;Babies come from blue lights and e.p.t. tests and the wet spot on clean sheets;Lonely knees that bump beneath the table; love letters sealedwith a miss and $758 phone bills; eyeliner and lips to match; muscledThighs and a sweet, milky quarter of yes in the center of pink panties.You came from this: a separated daddy and a desperate mama; A ripped sonogram and hours spent on hardwood floors asking  girlfriends:Should I go through with this?Grandma’s washboard and the dust tracks Grandaddy made when heleft her with five girls to maimYou came from this: Maryland rain, nights of shag carpet lovin’ and daysJust $2 short of the rent;And one afternoon you cameI wanted your father so badly it hurtEven took his last name and flung it behind yours like a spare tireWhatever he gave me was never enoughIt was like his love was a sieveAnd my desire for himWaterI was insanePacked my dreams in a U-Haul and moved them to MDNothing better to do30 and scaredYou came from this:Collision of longingTongue kissing and shameThe emptiness at the corner of GA AvenueAnd the fullness of swollen ankles and readjusted dreamsYou came from:A poet and a singerFists and car keysPeach cobbler and gumboLoveAnd that last dirty fight on the BeltwayYou came babyYou came, here”And she’ll say:“Mama, babies come from peach cobbler?”and I’ll sayyes.
