
When this day returns to meI will value your heart, long hurt in long division,over mine. Mouth above mine too —say you love me, truth never moremeant, say you are angry.Words, words we net with our mouths.Soul is an old thirst but not as firstas the body’s perhaps,though on bad nights its melancholyeats us out, to a person.True, time is undigressing.Yet true is all we can be:rhyming you, rhyming me.
