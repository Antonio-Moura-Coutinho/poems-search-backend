I am a wish in the skiesspun out from celestial space to be poor,to be covered with black skin, a feltquilt of a map with only one way to China — through pain as big as hogs squealingat killing time on black farms in Alabama — the noise of death, the shrill needlethat turns clouds over to rip the airabove the cities where people are youngand all that is given is never taken away.
