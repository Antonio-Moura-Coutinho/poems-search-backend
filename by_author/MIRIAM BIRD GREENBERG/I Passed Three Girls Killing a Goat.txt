It was hookedbetween the tendons of its back legsto a high branch that gently creakedlike a dry hinge busybody aunties wouldn’t oil.Blood drained into a pail, you could smell itshifting with the air, and black flies landedin the shadows of things where the winddidn’t touch. I dreamed I was carrying a sackfilled with animals, and it dragged bloodin the gravel and stained my skirt hem, you could follow my trailto the county line where old mensat on the liquor store porch. One crooked his half-armfor the bottle where the auger had caught his hand.I dreamed I was in a new country rinsing liversunder a spigot, and the men crackingblack walnuts on a stone named my limbslike the weather, like none of us knewthe same words. By the tree the girls and the goatwere faltering, one squatted to sharpenher blackened blade on a strop, and the menon the county line leaned back on the heelsof their chairs talking about anything, each other,spring weather, the long-haired boy scalpedby a combine, and one of them swore you only plantbeans with the moon in Capricorn otherwisethe fields choke up with scrub juniper. Onelooked intently at his left palm; his right wristuselessly brushed the woven seat of his chair.When a wind came, the screen door leapt upon its leather hinges which never creakedand slammed shut. Mud daubers in the muckby the spigot blew sideways around my ankles and upunder my skirt, and inside I could hearthe woman who lived with the liquor store proprietorcursing as she locked up the vanilla like she knewhow to break the back of a ghost.
