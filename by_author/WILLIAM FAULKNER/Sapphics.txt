
So it is: sleep comes not on my eyelids.Nor in my eyes, with shaken hair and whiteAloof pale hands, and lips and breasts of iron,   So she beholds me.And yet though sleep comes not to me, there comesA vision from the full smooth brow of sleep,The white Aphrodite moving unbounded   By her own hair.In the purple beaks of the doves that draw her,Beaks straight without desire, necks bent backwardToward Lesbos and the flying feet of Loves   Weeping behind her.She looks not back, she looks not back to whereThe nine crowned muses about ApolloStand like nine Corinthian columns singing    In clear evening.She sees not the Lesbians kissing mouthTo mouth across lute strings, drunken with singing,Nor the white feet of the Oceanides   Shining and unsandalled.Before her go cryings and lamentationsOf barren women, a thunder of wings,While ghosts of outcast Lethean women, lamenting,   Stiffen the twilight.
