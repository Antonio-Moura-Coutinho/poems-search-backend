
Her house is empty and her heart is old,And filled with shades and echoes that deceiveNo one save her, for still she tries to weaveWith blind bent fingers, nets that cannot hold.Once all men’s arms rose up to her, ‘tis told,And hovered like white birds for her caress:A crown she could have had to bind each tressOf hair, and her sweet arms the Witches’ Gold. Her mirrors know her witnesses, for thereShe rose in dreams from other dreams that lentHer softness as she stood, crowned with soft hair.And with his bound heart and his young eyes bentAnd blind, he feels her presence like shed scent,Holding him body and life within its snare.
