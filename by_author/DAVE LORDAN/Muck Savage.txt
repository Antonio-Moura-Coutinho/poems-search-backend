Can’t recallwho I tagged along to the festival with,what o’clock or eve it is, precisely    ...How the trout am I gonna get home?    ...    Did I bringa tent    ...    Yo! What the sugar’s the hun withthe glow sticks, the yokes, the coloredy fleececalled again?    ...    If you fly with the crows you’ll be shot withthe crows    ...    my Dad said. Could be doing with a suckon a spliff    ...    a dab    ...    so scanning fore, then midgroundfor someone to tap, I sketch three paralyticsat a tipped-over shitehouse, legless, claspingwire fence to hold upright. Never piss on electric wire.In Tipperary Gah shirts. Tall guys. Hurlers.Sinewy bastards. Dude in the middle bendingdouble belching steam and spittle like a hot bogin Iceland, chucking up loads. Distressed he is.Heavyweight retching bout. Losing control.Nearly throwing the towel in, collallapsing.I see him stretched out to dissolvein the land and its zillions of ants, trillionsof carcasses. What a banquet he’d makefor the jackdaws. If ya lie down withthe dogs ya’ll rise up with the fleas. Small urgein me for calling an ambulance. Smallbut rapidly growing. ’Til the others startegging him on. G’wan Jamey! Fucking championcraic man! Jamey swims with the general will —hauls himself rigid and warrior-tall,drawing gallon-swills of boosting oxygen,then arches crablike at the waist to balancebackwards on his massive palms, stallingas the constellations eddy, the cosmos rearrangesaround him, ’til his whistling tongue-tipcomes aligned with the prong of The Ploughand he launches like Polaris through the murk,propelling himself straight, hurling bilious floodsof intermingled crackers, croutons, crisps,sausage rolls, Diarmuid’s Special Offer Salsa Dips,Guinness, Smirnoff Ice, Devil’s Bit, roasted nutsand Dubonnet and effervescent codeine foam and fizzupupupup over the fenceup over the flagsup over the maizedown into the pinesdown into the flamesdown into the rave.
