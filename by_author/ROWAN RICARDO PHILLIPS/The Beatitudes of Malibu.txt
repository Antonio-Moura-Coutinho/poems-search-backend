A poem is the palm of the ocean,Closing. It or she or he is merely,Which means it or she or he is a mar.But a mar made up of  temperament andTempo — the red weather in the heart.iii I’m about to get this all wrong, I know:Santa Monica behind me, the oceanTo my left, Jupiter high above me,And Malibu somewhere in my mind, fleckedWith mist and dusk and Dylan and strange graysIn the sunsets that stripe the seaside hillsLike the tricolor of a country madeOf  beauty, the dream of beauty, and smog.Sadly, in my mind it’s always snowing;Which is beautiful but austere, unlike here.iv Along the thin pedestrian passageBeside the PCH, just off Sunset,Mel Gibson chants of beginnings and endsAnd lies and facts — Jews and Blacks beingBoth the lies and facts. His face is ruddyLike bruschetta. He storms at the policeBecause fuck them. He’s wearing his T-shirtLike a toga. He schools them his togaWisdom from toga times. He offers themHis toga. They offer him a ride — .v Arun’s car carried us like metaphorIn a poem or painting; moving meaning;Moving the current; being the current;The terse tug of tides: still the great glamour;Still, even as we speed on the 110,The music in my head, the JupiterOf the mind’s unstemmed Pacific OceanAs it unfurls in the vapor trail ofMalibu, fragrant in far-off fluorescents,Like a nocturnal flower calling you.vi Then, Downtown LA and LA Live surgedUp, like marginalia on a newlyTurned page, spangled with bland suggestions,Fiery accusations of its ownBrilliance that descend into indifference.We speed nearer and it grows. We veer andIt grows. We park and it grows. Close your eyes.Now look. And it has grown. Yo la quiero.But I should know better, if just becauseYou can smell the injustice in the air.vii The Pacific encircles me. Slowly.As though it doesn’t trust me. Or, betterSaid, I only understand it this way:By feeling like a stranger at its blueDoor. The poet with the sea stuck in hisEnjambments can’t call out to some CathayAs though some Cathay exists and be glad.No, the differences we have should be feltAnd made, through that feeling, an eclipsed lack;A power to take in what you can’t take back.viii The old hocus of this ocean’s focusOn pulling its waves over the soft surfLike a skin pulled down tight over the topOf a drum was, to her, a new hocus.We stared out with her, out toward Hokusai’sTiny boats and rising lace-fringed sea swellsNo chunk of haiku could think to charter.It was like the eighth day of creationIn the eighth line of a poem — she sang,She didn’t sing, the sea sang, then stopped.
