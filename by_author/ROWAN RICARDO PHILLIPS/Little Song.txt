A hornBlares its inner air to brass. A girl shakesHer ass. Some dude does the same. The music’sGone moot. Who doesn’t love it when the bassDoesn’t hide? When you can feel the trumpet peelOld oil and spit from deep down the emptyPit of a note or none or few? So don’tGive up on it yet: the scenario.You know that it’s just as tired of youAs you are of it. Still, there’s much more to itThan that. It does not not get you quite wrong.
