
The vase was made of clay
With spines of straw
For strength. The sunbaked vase
Soaked in a deep blue dye for days. The events in this wilderness,
Portrayed in the round of the vase,
Depend on shades of indigo against
The masked areas of the clay, a flat pearl color
To detail the big sky and snow...
This Montana field in winter is not sorrowful:
A bugle skips through notes:
We view it all somehow from the center of the field
And there are scattered groups of cavalry. Some of these
Men were seasoned by civil war. Their caps are blue.
Their canteens are frozen. The horses shake their heads
Bothered by beads of ice, the needles of ice
Forming at both sides of their great anvil heads.
The long, blue cloaks of the officers fall over the haunches
Of the horses. The ammunition wagons
Beside the woods are blurred by the snowy weather...
Beyond the wagons, farther even, into the woods
There is a sloping streambed. This is
The dark side of the vase which is often misunderstood.
From here through the bare trees there’s
A strange sight to be seen at the very middle of the field:
A valet is holding a bowl of cherries—archetype and rubric,
A general with white hair eats the fruit while introducing its color
Which will flow through the woods in early December.
An Indian woman came under dark clouds to give birth, unattended
In the deep wash inside the woods. She knew the weather
Could turn and staked the tips of two rooted spruce trees
To the earth to make a roof.
The deerskin of her robe is in her mouth. Her legs spread,
He feet are tied up in the roof of darkening spruce. No stars
Show through!
