
I follow locusts. I think they’re loyal, but it’s a story.In morning’s bleached streets and nightsof tungsten glinting, their fretted steel legsticker the minutes. What do I know, except I needa thing to walk behind. The lot tagged The Devil,red spray paint, two concrete steps. This is where I gowhen the heat comes, when no one alive can tell mehow to make the day move on. She lies there, the bitch,in a bed convex from her weight. Though it’s dusk,I see she is the color of dirt. Though ﬂeas opennew roads through her hair, she is asleep. I hear thunder.Some days it rumbles dry, no rain. I’m tired. The air here,it’s like breathing gasoline. I lie down, too. A razor,a latex glove turned inside out. I curl my body closeto hers, my lips, nose to her spine. I close my eyes.I want the mites to leave without me, but they don’t.
