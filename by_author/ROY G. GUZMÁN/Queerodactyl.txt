berry budding in water tiger
lilies claiminghocus-pocus wonder. I was broken
vanity, vixen vase, victorious tête-
à-tête — the Scrabble game nobody wonbecause the tiles aspired speculums.
Ocean-misaligned brook / brook-misalignedagua
— where else could these gospels have dawned
if not in the bellies of men
hyenaing a becoming?Twerking in church,
I outperformed the candles
diarized in the simpleminded annexation.       Wussup,Blastoise
with the veiniest homeboundpika-pika aim?
Wussup, SimsChumbawamba Family Portrait Simulation?St. Sunny of the Sissies
beheld the bukkake throngof mojo-coated cartilage
squanderedon the refurbished bunk
for new cetaceans. A dazzling jeremiadshone me dead
until I gridlocked the algebraic expressionsof my body in question marks.These syndicated fiyahs
stigmatized my herculean magmashades,but I held these walls apart,
every inch of my mascara cut offapple pie.You watched me hobble home
while the streets coalesced magenta. Tell Mommathe holes I cover with one error
swell — & there are only inadvertent landscapesto dollop with nonetheless.
