
Ghost sun halfhidden, where did you go?There’s always a motherof some other creatureborn to fight for her young.But crawl out of your hide,walk upright like a man,& you may ask if hunger is the only passionas you again lose yourselfin a white field’s point of view.In this glacial quietnothing moves except—then a flash of eyes & nerves.If cornered in your head by cries from a cavein another season, you can’t forgetin this landscape a pretty horsetranslates into a man holding a gun.
