The dreamy-eyed boy still in the man,the girl in the woman, a sunny forecast    behind today, but tomorrow’s beyondwords. To behold a body of water    is to know pig iron & mother wit. Whoever this figure is,    he will soon return to dancing through the aroma of dagger’s log,    ginger lily, & bougainvillea,between chants & strings struck    till gourds rally the healing air,& till the church-steeple birds    fly sweet darkness home.Whoever this friend or lover is,    he intones redemptive harmonies. To lie down in remembrance    is to know each of us is a prodigalson or daughter, looking out beyond land    & sky, the chemical & metaphysicalbeyond falling & turning waterwheels    in the colossal brain of damnable gods,a Eureka held up to the sun’s blinding eye,    born to gaze into fire. After conqueringfrontiers, the mind comes back to rest,     stretching out over the white sand.
