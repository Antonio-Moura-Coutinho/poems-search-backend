He cursed the moon,interned in a camp before he wascarted on a ship back to Tokyo.Hadn’t he almost died for artthe evenings he ate bread soup?If he wished to forget those days& nights dancing in drawing roomsin London, or translating Fenollosa’snotes on Noh, he’d have to unbraidhimself from At the Hawk’s Well,& then let go of the Egyptianmask Dulac painted him into —claws, beak, feathers, & legend.Why did that silly boy tell a storyabout his grandmother weepingwhen she first saw him dressedin his grandfather’s samurai armorto hold the gaze of Lady Cunard?He was again studying the foxholding a biscuit in his hand,saying, “I went to a great hillin Hampstead & I made my soulinto the soul of a fox.” Finally,he would let go of his Europe,& not think of those he loved& taught, Isadora lost. Now,powerless & alone, he danceshis ten steps again & again,wanting to know if a hawkcould peck the eyes out of a fox.
