Not to one who’s lainIn Heaven before God’s throne with eyes abased,Worshipping Him, in many forms of Good,That sate thereon; turning this patchwork worldWholly to glorify Him, point His planToward some supreme perfection, dimly visionedBy loving faith: not these to him, when, stressedBy some soul-dizzying woe beyond his trust,He lifts his startled face, and finds the ThroneEmpty, turns away, too drunk with TruthTo mind his shame, or feel the loss of God.
