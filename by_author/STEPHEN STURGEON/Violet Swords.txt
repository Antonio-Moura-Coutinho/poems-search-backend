Todaysilence has come to see what no one sees,it’s always grim at the start of the play.Fellows, who wait à propos their introsclawing at the panels, such shrill tigers,thrive unthreading the hems of the heroes.Friends of our late friend are minor-leaguersnever to be called up but good as types,people who will hook bras to the flagpole,bake chocolate for a gray stranger  ...    She wipesaway red records of the stocks you stole  ...    Yesterday, books were thrown from the third floor,out the window, they sank in pairs like shoes,and I watch violet swords on a white shore,blade-tip laid across blade-tip, where it snows.
