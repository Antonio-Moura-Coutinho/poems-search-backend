
When the corpse revived at the funeral,The outraged mourners killed it; and the soulOf the revenant passed into the bodyOf the poet because it had more to say.He sat down at the piano no one could playCalled Messiah, or The Regulator of the World,Which had stood for fifty years, to my knowledge,Beneath a painting of a red-haired womanIn a loose gown with one bared breast, and playedA posthumous work of the composer S——About the impotence of God (I believe)Who has no power not to create everything.It was the Autumn of the year and wet,When the music started.  The musician wasSkillful but the Messiah was out of tuneAnd bent the time and the tone.  For a long hourThe poet played The Regulator of the WorldAs the spirit prompted, and entered uponThe pathways of His power—while the mournersStood with slow blood on their handsAstonished by the weird processionalAnd the undertaker figured his bill.—We have in mind an unplayed instrumentWhich stands apart in a memorial airWhere the room darkens toward its inmost wallAnd a lady hangs in her autumnal hairAt evening of the November rains; and windsSublime out of the North, and North by West,Are sowing from the death-sack of the seedThe burden of her cloudy hip.  Behold,I send the demon I know to relieve your need,An imperfect player at the perfect instrumentWho takes in hand The Regulator of the WorldTo keep the splendor from destroying us.Lady!  The last virtuoso of the composer S——Darkens your parlor with the music of the Law.When I was green and blossomed in the SpringI was mute wood.  Now I am dead I sing.
