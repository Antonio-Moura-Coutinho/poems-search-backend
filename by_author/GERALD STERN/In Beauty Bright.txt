
In beauty-bright and such it was like Blake’s lily and though an angel he looked absurddragging a lily out of a beauty-bright storewrapped in tissue with a petal drooping,nor was it useless—you who know it knowhow useful it is—and how he would be deadin a minute if he were to lose it thoughhow do you lose a lily? His lily was whiteand he had a foolish smile there holding it up likea candelabrum in his right hand facing the mirror in the hall nor had the endlesscenturies started yet nor was there one thornbetween his small house and the beauty-bright store.
