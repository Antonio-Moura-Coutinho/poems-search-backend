
i early morning 
The rain, gray god with its huge hands
has shredded the roses, and clapping,
kept us up all night, the bridge washed out,
the troll waiting to gobble a goat.
How long has he been there, wet and cold,impatient, starving, his coat
rent with welts and matted with mist?Father, thundering, his voice full
of â€Šbracken and leaves, leaves that in
the autumn clogged the gutters. Who
goes over the bridge? Who goes there?
