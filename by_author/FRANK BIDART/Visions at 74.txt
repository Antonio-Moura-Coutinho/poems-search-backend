Weird joy to watch postulateslived out and discarded, something crowded inside us always craving to become somethingglistening outside us, the relentless planetshowing itself the logic of what is buried inside it. To love existenceis to love what is indifferent to youyou think, as you watch it turn there, beautiful. World that can know itself only by world, soon it must colonize and infect the stars.You are an hypothesis made of flesh. What you will teach the stars is constant rage at the constant prospect of not-being.

Sometimes when I wake it's because I hear
a knock. Knock,Knock. Two
knocks, quite clear.
I wake and listen. It's nothing.
