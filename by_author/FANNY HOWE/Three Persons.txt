Leaves flippedand palsied.The river is brown nearthe sand, loose banks and twigsstick at the edge and a lilac’ssilhouette of a child I love.How in the dark hole can I hideif   I can’t get outside?Then I won’t rememberwhat I did to deserve it.That arch and bridgewill form a shape of repentance. If  I’m hanging,then judgment has been passed.And I am hangingupside downhead swinging towards the moon.Years of  inversion.A face in a mirror displaced by its position outside silver.And so?Next will come muscle,a little grief   but no shoulder.•You’re learning how to be a unitwith an infinite in its attic.It’s not difficult. Light is the last message.White streaks like oil paintare the first to appear along the wet railing. Next similar colors correspond by chance.We would rather be (die) with total strangers than with partial ones      we realized in the elevator going down. It was the only time that day that we were as alone as we were awake.Sensing a justand impartial ghostclose to each living thingI could see the geniusof  institutional religion.Examine your conscience.Confess in darknessand take away a task.Soon you’ll wash off fleshscented by its parallel past.What were your feet thinking in their hurryto connect the parts?Get the children to the other side!What children? You were the one running.There was never any other.
