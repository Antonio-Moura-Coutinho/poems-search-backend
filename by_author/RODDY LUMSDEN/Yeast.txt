And yes, atnight, each microbe gurns in the salty seaof gut and gullet, born again, boldly eatsas you ate it, brews its own queasy teaof proto-raunch which it will quickly sate,birthing wanderlusting vigors, as yetunknown to microscience. They sashay, setout for the toes or gape through your eyes atyour drooping lids, your fat bunch of keys, atthis internal motel’s boss, bellhop, lackey, satin the throne of his slumber, a mercy seat.
