I’d seen down a Blenheim,two Lime Rickeys and was eyeing a gamine mixologistwho was straining out Savoy Royales when my raddlednemesis limped over to announce she had encounteredmy latest screed, all four foot eleven of her tortoiseishlyquivering, a nubbin of cream cheese on her whiskery lipand her good eye withering my borrowed companionetteas she leaned on air. I am not a man who has not knownthe turmoil women offer, the gift you accept of their wit,the way you’d slip a hand into a gloveful of cockroaches,comply with a last-minute call to join a seal cull. Tanya,I pouted, I am awed and honored you opened a windowin your schedule even to glance at my inconsequentialoutpourings. At which point she clattered out a scoffinggibe so sour you couldn’t blend it with a chemistry setfrom Hamley’s and, seizing my escort by her neat wrist,we tore out onto Jermyn Street, along which I performeda sort of shuffle, one eye on the book and one on m’lady’scompetition-standard backside as she led us to the Ritz.
