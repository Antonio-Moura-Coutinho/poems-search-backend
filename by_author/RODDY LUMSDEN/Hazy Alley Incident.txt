Girl shouting Oliver! at the top of the cut-throughby Jacob’s Gallery, you have now enteredthe slenderest of histories, the skin-bound bookI store between my temples; in that meanand moonless city, you must hang fraughtin your too-long coat, not a winner, but placed,and in this cutty version of forever, forevercalling on your unseen beau, one flake ina limbic blizzard, one spark in the synaptic blaze.And now the rain turns, light but going steadyon the Willamette. Along the bank, I lift my pacefrom devil-may-have-me to heading-somewhere and still your mouth in the haze calling isa ruby carbuncle woken by a miner’s head-beam,the reddest berry in the hedgerow, which allbut the bird in the fable know not to pluck.
