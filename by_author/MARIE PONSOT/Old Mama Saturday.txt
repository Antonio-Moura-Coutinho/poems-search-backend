“I’m moving from Grief  Street.Taxes are high herethough the mortgage’s cheap.The house is well built.With stuff to protect, thatmattered to me,the security.These things that I mind,you know, aren’t mine.I mind minding them.They weigh on my mind.I don’t mind them well.I haven’t got the knackof  kindly minding.I say Take them backbut you never do.When I throw them outit may frighten youand maybe me too.                 Maybeit will empty metoo emptilyand keep me hereasleep, at seaunder the guilt quilt,under the you tree.”
