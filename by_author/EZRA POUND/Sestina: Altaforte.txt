The scene is his castle, Altaforte. “Papiols” is his jongleur. “The Leopard,” the device of Richard (Cœur de Lion).                                    IDamn it all! all this our South stinks peace.You whoreson dog, Papiols, come! Let’s to music!I have no life save when the swords clash.But ah! when I see the standards gold, vair, purple, opposingAnd the broad fields beneath them turn crimson,Then howl I my heart nigh mad with rejoicing.                                     IIIn hot summer have I great rejoicingWhen the tempests kill the earth’s foul peace,And the light’nings from black heav’n flash crimson,And the fierce thunders roar me their musicAnd the winds shriek through the clouds mad, opposing,And through all the riven skies God’s swords clash.                                     IIIHell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!And the shrill neighs of destriers in battle rejoicing,Spiked breast to spiked breast opposing!Better one hour’s stour than a year’s peaceWith fat boards, bawds, wine and frail music!Bah! there’s no wine like the blood’s crimson!                                     IVAnd I love to see the sun rise blood-crimson.And I watch his spears through the dark clashAnd it fills all my heart with rejoicingAnd prys wide my mouth with fast musicWhen I see him so scorn and defy peace,His lone might ’gainst all darkness opposing.                                     VThe man who fears war and squats opposingMy words for stour, hath no blood of crimsonBut is fit only to rot in womanish peaceFar from where worth’s won and the swords clashFor the death of such sluts I go rejoicing;Yea, I fill all the air with my music.                                     VIPapiols, Papiols, to the music!There’s no sound like to swords swords opposing,No cry like the battle’s rejoicingWhen our elbows and swords drip the crimsonAnd our charges ’gainst “The Leopard’s” rush clash.May God damn for ever all who cry “Peace!”                                     VIIAnd let the music of the swords make them crimsonHell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!Hell blot black for always the thought “Peace”!
