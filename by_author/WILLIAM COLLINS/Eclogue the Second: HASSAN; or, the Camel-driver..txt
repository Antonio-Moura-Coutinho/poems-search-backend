In silent horror o’er the desert-wasteThe driver  Hassan with his camels past.One cruse of water on his back he bore,And his light scrip contained a scanty store:A fan of painted feathers in his hand,To guard his shaded face from scorching sand.The sultry sun had gained the middle sky,And not a tree, and not an herb was nigh.The beasts, with pain, their dusty way pursue,Shrill roared the winds, and dreary was the view!With desperate sorrow wild, th’ affrighted manThrice sighted, thrice struck his breast, and thus began:Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,
  When first from Schiraz’ walls I bent my way.
