My mother became an ornithologistwhen the grackle tumbled through barbecue smokeand fell at her feet. Soon she learnedwhy singers cage birds; it can take weeksto memorize a melody — the first days lost as they mopeand warble a friendless note,the same tone every animal memorizeshours into breathing. It’s a notea cologne would emit if the bottle was struckwhile something mystical was alignedwith something even more mysticalbut farther away. My father was an astronomerfor forty minutes in a rowthe first time a bus took us so farfrom streetlights he could point out constellationsthat may or may not have been Draco,Orion, Aquila, or Crux.When they faded I resented the sun’s excess,a combination of fires I couldn’t smell.The first chemist was a perfumerwhose combinations, brushedagainst pulse points, were unlockedby quickening blood. From stolen perfumesI concocted my personal toxin.It was no more deadly than as much waterto any creature the size of a roach. I grew suspiciousof my plate and lighter Bunsen burner,the tiny vials accumulating in my closet.I was a chemist for monthsbefore I learned the differencebetween poisoned and drowned.When my bed caught fireit smelled like a garden.
