To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we'll assess the intensity of various emotions expressed in the text.

Emotions detected in the text:
- Sadness: The text conveys a sense of loss, letting go, and the gradual departure of someone close, which indicates sadness.
- Love: The description of holding hands and the emotional connection with the person in the water suggests feelings of love.
- Awe: The imagery of the scene and the mention of shimmering minnows give a sense of wonder and awe.

Creating the emotion vector based on the detected emotions:
[Sadness: 0.6, Love: 0.4, Awe: 0.3, Happiness: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Saudade: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0]

This vector indicates that the text's predominant emotions are Sadness and Love, with lesser intensities of Awe and Melancholy. Happiness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust, Distrust, Saudade, Bittersweetness, and Nostalgia are not strongly present in the text.
