I have analyzed the emotional content of the text and generated the emotion vector based on the intensity of various emotions present in the text. Here is the emotion vector for the text you provided:

[0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0]

This vector indicates the presence and intensity of each emotion in the text. It suggests a higher intensity of emotions such as Anger, Disgust, Distrust, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, and Nostalgia, while other emotions like Happiness, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust, and Love have relatively lower intensities.
