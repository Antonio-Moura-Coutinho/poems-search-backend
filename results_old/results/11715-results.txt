To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will first identify the emotions present in the text and then assign a value between 0 and 1 to each emotion based on its intensity.

Emotions present in the text:

- Anticipation: The text contains elements that evoke a sense of anticipation, such as the reference to "secret blaze behind the wheels" and the imagery of being on a train journey.
- Awe: The text conveys a sense of wonder and awe, especially through descriptions of the train imagery and the atmosphere surrounding it.
- Nostalgia: There are elements in the text that evoke a feeling of nostalgia, such as references to "yesteryear's pall" and "passings-by of nailed-shut houses."
- Melancholy: The text carries a tone of sadness and wistfulness, particularly in the references to being "bare & barely rising" and the subtle mention of goodbye.

Emotion vector based on the analysis:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.3, 0]

This vector indicates a moderate presence of anticipation, some presence of nostalgia and melancholy, and a hint of awe in the text.
