To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to consider the overall tone and underlying emotions conveyed in the text. In this case, the text seems to evoke a sense of yearning, longing, and a touch of nostalgia. 

Based on the text, the emotional vector could be as follows: [0.2, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0]. 

This vector signifies a moderate level of Surprise, Anticipation, and Melancholy, while also indicating a hint of Awe. The absence of values for some emotions suggests that they are not prominent in this particular text.
