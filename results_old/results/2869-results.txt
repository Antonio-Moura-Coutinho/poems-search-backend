To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, let's identify and quantify the intensity of each emotion present in the text based on the provided emotions.

Emotions identified in the text and their intensities on a scale from 0 to 1:

- Happiness: 0
- Sadness: 0.6
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0
- Anger: 0
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0
- Trust: 0.2
- Distrust: 0
- Love: 0
- Saudade: 0.4
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0.3
- Melancholy: 0.6
- Nostalgia: 0.3

The emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion would be:

[0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.3] 

This vector suggests that the predominant emotions in the text are sadness, trust, saudade, bittersweetness, and melancholy, with some nostalgia present as well.
