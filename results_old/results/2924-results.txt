Based on the provided text, it is difficult to accurately determine the emotional content as the text is incomplete. However, I will provide a general emotion vector assuming there might be a nostalgic element to the incomplete text.

Emotion vector: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Since only the word "remember" is included, the strongest emotion inferred is Nostalgia, represented by a value of 1 in the vector. Other emotions have not been activated by the text. If you provide more context or text information, I would be able to provide a more accurate emotional analysis.
