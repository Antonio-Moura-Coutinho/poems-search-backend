To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we need to consider the underlying emotions conveyed by the words and context. Based on the text provided, we can identify the following emotions:

- Sadness: The text conveys a sense of solemnity, with the speaker expressing reluctance towards prayer and a feeling of not wanting to pray.
- Anticipation: There is an element of anticipation as the monks guide the seekers through a different task before reaching the garden of moss.
- Distrust: The speaker seems to have a sense of doubt or distrust, especially regarding the act of prayer and its simplicity.

With these identified emotions, we can construct the emotion vector as follows:
[0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector assigns a higher intensity to Sadness and Distrust, with a moderate level of Anticipation indicated by the text's narrative.
