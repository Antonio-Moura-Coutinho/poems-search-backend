To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we'll first identify and evaluate the emotional cues present in the text:

- Positive emotions (Happiness, Love, Anticipation, Trust):
  Examples of positive emotions in the text:
  - "he's high as a georgia pine"
  - "favorite southern trees"
  - "makes us grateful for southern trees"
  - "fuchsia, lavender, white, light pink, purple : crape myrtle bouquets burst"
  - "i've never forgotten"

- Neutral emotions (Surprise):
  The text doesn't contain explicit surprise-related emotions.

- Negative emotions (Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Distrust, Saudade, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, Nostalgia):
  Examples of negative emotions in the text:
  - "charred bitter fruit"
  - "shadow of southern trees"

Based on the emotional cues identified, we can create an emotion vector for the text:
