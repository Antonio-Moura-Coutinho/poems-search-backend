To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, I will examine the text for emotional cues. Based on contextual analysis and the words used, I will assess the intensity of various emotions indicated in the text.

Here is the emotion vector based on the emotional content of the text:

[0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.4, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0]

This vector represents the intensity of each emotion from 0 to 1 as requested.
