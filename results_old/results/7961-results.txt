To analyze the emotional content of the text provided and generate an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions expressed within the text and assess their intensity. Based on the text "The Knights of the Joyous Venture" by Puck of Pook's Hill, we can extract the following emotional elements:

- **Sadness**: The text conveys a sense of sadness, longing, and abandonment, particularly in lines such as "What is a woman that you forsake her" and "Yet, when the signs of summer thicken, And the ice breaks, and the birch-buds quicken, Yearly you turn from our side, and sicken." This emotion is dominant in the text.

- **Disgust**: There is a hint of disgust in the imagery of loneliness and desolation portrayed in lines like "That the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in" and "The ten-times-fingering weed to hold you." It is not as pronounced as sadness but is present.

- **Melancholy**: The text evokes a feeling of melancholy with reflections on loss, separation, and the passage of time. Phrases like "The sound of your oar-blades, falling hollow, Is all we have left through the months to follow" contribute to this emotion.

Based on the analysis, the emotion vector for the text can be represented as follows:
