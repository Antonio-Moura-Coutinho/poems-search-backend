To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to assess the dominant emotions conveyed in the passage. The text seems to evoke a sense of philosophical contemplation, inner turmoil, and a struggle against despair. The language used is poetic and introspective, focusing on themes of uncertainty, impermanence, and the limitations of human endeavor.

Based on the emotional content of the text, the emotion vector could be as follows:

[0.3, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.4, 0.6]

This vector represents moderate levels of sadness, fear, and melancholy, along with lower levels of other emotions such as happiness, disgust, anger, and anticipation. It also indicates a stronger presence of bittersweetness, nostalgia, and a sense of longing or saudade.
