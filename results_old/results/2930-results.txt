Happiness: The mention of Christmas and the gesture of wanting to wish someone a Merry Christmas convey a sense of happiness.
Sadness: There is a slight hint of sadness in the reluctance to sell the Christmas trees and the contemplation of letting them go.
Fear: There is a mild sense of fear or hesitation when the narrator contemplates the idea of selling the Christmas trees.
Trust: The interaction between the narrator and the stranger involves a level of trust when discussing the trees.

Love: The care and attachment to the Christmas trees suggest a sense of love or fondness.
Nostalgia: The mention of Christmas trees and the sentiment of wanting to send one as a gift evoke feelings of nostalgia for the holiday season.

Based on the analysis, the emotion vector could look like this: [0.6, 0.1, 0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0, 0.2, 0.1, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1]. Each value in the vector represents the intensity of the corresponding emotion on a scale from 0 to 1.
