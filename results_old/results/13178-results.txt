To analyze the emotional content of the text, I will extract the emotions expressed in each stanza before calculating the emotion vector:

I: Sadness (0.8), Fear (0.3)
II: Sadness (0.6), Trust (0.3)
III: Sadness (0.7), Fear (0.5)
IV: Love (0.9), Trust (0.7), Happiness (0.6)
V: Anticipation (0.4), Trust (0.6)
VI: Sadness (0.7), Trust (0.8), Anticipation (0.4)
VII: Trust (0.9)
VIII: Fear (0.5), Disgust (0.4), Anticipation (0.4)
IX: Fear (0.7), Sadness (0.6)
X: Fear (0.6), Sadness (0.5)
XI: Fear (0.7), Distrust (0.5), Anger (0.4)
XII: Sadness (0.7), Disgust (0.4)

Now, we will calculate the emotion vector based on the emotional content of the text:

[Sadness: 0.712, Fear: 0.536, Happiness: 0.15, Disgust: 0.133, Anger: 0.067, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.233,
