To analyze the emotional content of the text, let's break it down to identify the emotional cues and then create an emotion vector based on the intensity of each emotion present in the text.

Emotional cues identified:
- Happiness: Absence
- Sadness: Present (Mention of pain, being jobless, drivel)
- Fear: Absence
- Disgust: Present (Using mother's hate, learning hygiene from a raccoon)
- Anger: Absence
- Surprise: Absence
- Anticipation: Present (Preparing for interview)
- Trust: Absence
- Distrust: Absence
- Love: Absence
- Saudade: Absence
- Awe: Absence
- Bittersweetness: Absence
- Melancholy: Present (Feeling pain, being jobless, drivel)
- Nostalgia: Absence

Emotion vector: [0, 0.4, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector suggests that the text evokes a moderate level of sadness, disgust, and anticipation, along with a hint of melancholy.
