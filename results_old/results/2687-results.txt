To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, I will take into account the emotions expressed through the words and overall tone of the text. The emotions that stand out in the text are:

1. Sadness - The text conveys a sense of melancholy and contemplation.
2. Anger - There are elements of anger and frustration in the descriptions of racial disparities and societal expectations.
3. Disgust - The mention of bleach burning clothes and racial stereotypes can evoke a feeling of disgust.
4. Anticipation - There is a hint of anticipation or questioning about societal changes and expectations.

Based on the emotional analysis, the emotion vector for the text could be:
[0, 0.6, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The vector indicates a high intensity of sadness and anger, moderate levels of disgust and anticipation, and low or no presence of other emotions.
