To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, I will go through the text and identify the emotions conveyed. 

After analyzing the text, the emotions present and their intensities are represented in the following emotion vector:

[0.15, 0.45, 0.65, 0.6, 0.4, 0.15, 0.5, 0.2, 0.35, 0.15, 0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.4, 0.6]

This vector indicates that the text primarily conveys emotions such as Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Anticipation, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, and Nostalgia with varying intensities.
