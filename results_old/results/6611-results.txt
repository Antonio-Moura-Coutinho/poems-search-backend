To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we need to assess the intensity of various emotions conveyed in the text. Based on the provided text, the emotional content can be interpreted as follows:

- Happiness: 0
- Sadness: 0.3
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0
- Anger: 0
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0.2
- Trust: 0.2
- Distrust: 0
- Love: 0
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0.3
- Melancholy: 0.4
- Nostalgia: 0

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1 would be: [0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0].
