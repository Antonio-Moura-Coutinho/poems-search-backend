To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we can extract the emotional tones and intensities present in the writing. 

Based on the text, the following emotion vector can be constructed:

[Happiness: 0.1, Sadness: 0.7, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.3, Trust: 0.4, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.2, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.1, Bittersweetness: 0.3, Melancholy: 0.7, Nostalgia: 0.5]

In this analysis, the emotions of sadness, melancholy, and nostalgia are prevalent and are assigned high intensity values, indicating a theme of mourning and reflection on the loss of the grandfather. Anticipation and trust also have moderate intensity values, reflecting anticipation of rituals and trust in the process of honoring the deceased. Other emotions such as happiness and fear have low intensity values, reflecting their minimal presence in the text.
