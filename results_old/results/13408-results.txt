To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we will need to assess the prevalent emotions conveyed in the text:

Happiness: 0
Sadness: 0.7
Fear: 0
Disgust: 0
Anger: 0
Surprise: 0
Anticipation: 0
Trust: 0
Distrust: 0
Love: 0
Saudade: 0
Awe: 0
Bittersweetness: 0.3
Melancholy: 0.9
Nostalgia: 0.5

The resulting emotion vector based on the intensity of each emotion would be:
[0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.9, 0.5]
