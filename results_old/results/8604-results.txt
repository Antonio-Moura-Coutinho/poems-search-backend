Based on the emotional content of the text, the emotion vector could be calculated as follows:

[Happiness: 0.6, Sadness: 0.1, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.3, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.7, Distrust: 0 , Love: 0.5, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.6, Bittersweetness: 0.3, Melancholy: 0.2, Nostalgia: 0]

This suggests that the text conveys a mix of positive emotions like happiness, trust, love, awe, and anticipation, with lower intensities of surprise and bittersweetness. Sadness, fear, and distrust are almost absent from the emotional content of the text.
