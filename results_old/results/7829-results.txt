To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions expressed throughout the text. Based on the content, the emotions found in the text include:

- Happiness: The mention of splendor, shining together, and happiness being expressed despite their current state.
- Awe: Descriptions of the shimmering scales and the iridescent, watery prismatics evoke a sense of awe.
- Love: The collective nature of the fish ("all for all", "be together"), selflessness, and unity suggest a theme of love.
- Melancholy: There is a bittersweet tone in the text, especially in the reflections on individuality and existence.
