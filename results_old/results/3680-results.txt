The provided text does not contain explicit emotional content that can be analyzed to generate an emotion vector. It appears to be a list of plant and flower names, which do not inherently convey specific emotions. If you have another text or content with emotional cues that you'd like me to analyze for generating an emotion vector, please provide it, and I'd be happy to assist with that.
