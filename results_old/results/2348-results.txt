To analyze the emotional content of the text you provided and generate an emotion vector, I will consider the following emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust, Distrust, Love, Saudade, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, Nostalgia.

Analyzing the text, the emotions it evokes are:

- Anticipation: The text talks about ascension and demanding the flame, which may create a sense of anticipation.
- Awe: The imagery of lightning and the concept of flame can evoke a feeling of awe.
- Melancholy: The contemplative tone and themes of impermanence and mortality suggest a sense of melancholy.

The emotion vector based on the emotional content of the text would be:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0]

Please note that the vector reflects the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1 based on the identified emotions in the text.
