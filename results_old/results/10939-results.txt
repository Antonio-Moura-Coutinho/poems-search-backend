To analyze the emotional content of the given text and provide an emotion vector, I will examine the text for emotional cues and intensity. Based on the text provided, the emotions displayed seem to include elements of Fear and Suspense with some similarity to a Grave. The repetitive nature of the actions described, digging up what looks like a grave, can evoke a sense of unease, hinting at underlying Fear. Let's construct the emotion vector:

Emotion Vector: [0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

1. Happiness: 0
2. Sadness: 0
3. Fear: 0.8
4. Disgust: 0
5. Anger: 0
6. Surprise: 0
7. Anticipation: 0.6
8. Trust: 0

10. Love: 0
11. Saudade: 0
12. Awe: 0
13. Bittersweetness: 0
14. Melancholy: 0

This vector indicates a high level of Fear and Anticipation, associated with the suspenseful and eerie element of the text, while other emotions are not significantly present.
