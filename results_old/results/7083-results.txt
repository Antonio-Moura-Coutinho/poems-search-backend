To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate the emotion vector, we will assess the intensity of each emotion based on the context of the poem:

Happiness: 0.1
Sadness: 0.7
Fear: 0.1
Disgust: 0
Anger: 0
Surprise: 0.3
Anticipation: 0.4
Trust: 0.6
Distrust: 0
Love: 0.3
Saudade: 0.4
Awe: 0.4
Bittersweetness: 0.6
Melancholy: 0.7
Nostalgia: 0.5

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the emotional content of the text is:
[0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.5]
