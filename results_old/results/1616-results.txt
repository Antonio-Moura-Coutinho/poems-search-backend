To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we'll need to carefully interpret the feelings and emotions conveyed through the language used. After examining the text, here is the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1:

[Happiness: 0.1, Sadness: 0.6, Fear: 0.1, Disgust: 0.1, Anger: 0.1, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.2, Trust: 0.1, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.2, Saudade: 0.1, Awe: 0.2, Bittersweetness: 0.3, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0.4]

This emotional vector reflects a predominant sense of sadness, mixed with elements of melancholy, nostalgia, bittersweetness, and a hint of anticipation and love. The text conveys a reflective, wistful, and somewhat sorrowful tone, with traces of longing and contemplation.
