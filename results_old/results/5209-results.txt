To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we can identify the emotions expressed in the text:

- Sadness: The mention of rusty leaves, blue haze, and bleakness in the description of the setting conveys a sense of melancholy and sadness.
- Melancholy: The overall tone of the text is melancholic and reflective, emphasizing the passage of time and the end of a season.

Based on these emotional cues, we can create an emotion vector representing the intensity of sadness and melancholy in the text:

[0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0]

This vector indicates a high intensity of sadness and melancholy and low intensity of other emotions.
