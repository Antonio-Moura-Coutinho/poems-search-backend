The emotional content of the text includes elements of Anger, Disgust, Contempt, Triumph, and Satisfaction. Based on this analysis, I will provide an emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion:

[0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector captures the high intensity of Anger and Disgust, portraying strong feelings of resentment and disdain towards the subject of the text. Additionally, the presence of Triumph and Satisfaction reflects the sense of victory and closure experienced by the speaker in overcoming the challenges presented in the narrative.
