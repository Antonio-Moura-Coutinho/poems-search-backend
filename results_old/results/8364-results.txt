To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we can identify the intensity of each emotion expressed in the text:

- Happiness: 0
- Sadness: 1
- Fear: 1
- Disgust: 0
- Anger: 0
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0
- Trust: 0
- Distrust: 0
- Love: 0
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0
- Melancholy: 1
- Nostalgia: 0

The resulting emotion vector based on the intensity of each emotion would be: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0].
