To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions conveyed in the text and assess their intensity. Based on the text, we can observe the following emotions and their intensities:

- Happiness: 0.4
- Sadness: 0.6
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0
- Anger: 0
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0.3
- Trust: 0.7
- Distrust: 0
- Love: 0.9
- Saudade: 0.2
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0.8

Therefore, the emotion vector for the text would be: [0.4, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.7, 0, 0.9, 0.2, 0, 0.8, 0.7, 1].
