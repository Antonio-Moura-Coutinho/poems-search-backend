To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, I will need to assess the predominant emotions expressed in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the emotional analysis:

[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.3, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0.1, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.5, Nostalgia: 0.4]

This emotion vector indicates that the text evokes stronger feelings of sadness, melancholy, nostalgia, and bittersweetness, with elements of trust and anticipation as well. The imagery of childhood, captivity, and exiling oneself from what one was contributes to the predominant emotions of sadness and nostalgia.
