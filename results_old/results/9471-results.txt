To analyze the emotional content of the text, we need to look at the overall tone and context of the text. Since this text contains a set of instructions or rules regarding the use of the lift, it does not explicitly convey any emotional content related to the emotions in the emotion vector list.

Given the lack of emotional cues or content in the text, the emotion vector for this text would predominantly consist of zeros for all emotions. However, I can provide you with a neutral emotion vector to represent this text:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This emotion vector reflects the absence of emotional cues in the provided text about the use of the lift. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
