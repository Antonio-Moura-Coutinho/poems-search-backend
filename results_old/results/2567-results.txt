The emotional content of the text contains elements of melancholy, nostalgia, and perhaps a hint of bittersweetness. The melancholic tone is conveyed through the imagery of the ploughman who slept out in the cold, and the nostalgic feeling arises from the mention of the Hawthorn Bush and the reference to where he now sleeps in France. The secrecy around his final resting place adds a bittersweet touch to the overall sentiment.
