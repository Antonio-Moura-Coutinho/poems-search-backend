To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will need to identify the predominant emotions expressed in the text. After analyzing the text, the emotions detected are:

- Sadness
- Love
- Anticipation

The emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1 is as follows:

[Sadness: 0.7, Love: 0.6, Anticipation: 0.4, Happiness: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0, Nostalgia: 0]

This emotion vector reflects the emotional intensity of sadness, love, and anticipation present in the text.
