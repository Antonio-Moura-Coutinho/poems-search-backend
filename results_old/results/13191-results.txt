To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, I will consider the emotions conveyed throughout the text. Based on the imagery and themes presented, the emotions appear to include elements of awe, sadness, nostalgia, melancholy, and possibly a hint of trust and bittersweetness. Here is the emotion vector representing the intensity of these emotions in the text:

[0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.6, 0]

This emotion vector indicates high levels of nostalgia, melancholy, bittersweetness, and awe, with moderate levels of sadness and a slight hint of trust.
