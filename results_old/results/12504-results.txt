To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, I will identify and quantify the intensity of emotions expressed throughout the text. Based on the content, here is the emotion vector:

[0.1, 0.9, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 0.6, 0.1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.7, 0.5, 0.8, 0.7, 0.7]

Explanation of emotions:
- Happiness: 0.1 (Mild expressions of happiness are present, especially in moments like the protagonist finding comfort in the phrase "the real thing.")
- Sadness: 0.9 (The predominant emotion expressed throughout the text is sadness, especially relating to the protagonist's struggles with self-image and rejection by others.)
- Fear: 0.7 (Fear is evident in the descriptions of how others perceive and treat the protagonist, generating a sense of unease.)
- Disgust: 0.8 (There is a strong sense of disgust portrayed in how the protagonist is viewed and treated by those around him.)
- Anger: 0.7 (Feelings of anger are displayed by the protagonist's mother and glimpses of the protagonist's own frustration with his situation.)
- Surprise: 0.5 (Surprise is reflected by the unexpected events and reactions the protagonist encounters.)
