To analyze the emotional content of the given text and provide an emotion vector, I will consider the emotions conveyed through the language used and the overall tone of the text.

Based on the text, the emotions expressed include:

- Frustration (expressed through feeling overwhelmed by the constant flow of new books and inability to keep up)
- A sense of being behind (due to the fast pace of modern authors and the growing unread book pile)
- Feeling overwhelmed (by the abundance of reading material and the pressure to stay updated)

I will now calculate the emotion vector based on the intensity of the identified emotions:

Frustration = 0.7
Feeling Behind = 0.5
Feeling Overwhelmed = 0.6

I will normalize these values to create an emotion vector where the sum of all intensities equals 1:

Frustration = 0.7 / (0.7 + 0.5 + 0.6) = 0.35
Feeling Behind = 0.5 / (0.7 + 0.5 + 0.6) = 0.25
Feeling Overwhelmed = 0.6 / (0.7 + 0.5 + 0.6) = 0.30

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the emotional content of the text would be as follows:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
