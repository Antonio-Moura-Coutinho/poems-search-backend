To analyze the emotional content of the text, we can identify the following emotions:

Sadness: The text conveys a sense of longing, existential contemplation, and a feeling of being lost or detached. This suggests a strong presence of sadness.

Anticipation: The repetition of phrases like "I won't" followed by the list of contrasting dualities creates a sense of anticipation or expectancy as one tries to reconcile these apparent contradictions.

Trust: The mention of losing oneself in the repeated utterance of a name implies a sense of trust or reliance on something beyond oneself.

Existential themes like the ephemeral nature of identity, interconnectivity, and the speaker's perceived non-existence evoke a combination of complexity and introspection that could be associated with emotions like Awe, Love, and Trust.
