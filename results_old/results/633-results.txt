To analyze the emotional content of the text, we need to identify the underlying emotions present in the passage. From the text, we can observe a mixture of emotions such as Sadness, Disgust, Anticipation, and somewhat of a detached contemplation. Based on this observation, the emotion vector could be represented as follows:

[0, 0.6, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector indicates a high intensity of Sadness and Disgust, moderate Anticipation, and a lack of other specific emotional cues.
