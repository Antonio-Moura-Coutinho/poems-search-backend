To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, we need to assess the underlying emotions portrayed in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the emotional content of the text:

[Happiness: 0.1, Sadness: 0.2, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0.2, Anger: 0.3, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.2, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0.2, Love: 0.4, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0.1, Melancholy: 0.1, Nostalgia: 0.3]

This emotion vector indicates that the text primarily conveys emotions of Anger, Disgust, and Distrust, with elements of Love, Trust, and Nostalgia present to a lesser extent.
