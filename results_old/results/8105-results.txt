To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will examine the text for various emotions and assign intensity values on a scale from 0 to 1. Based on the emotional content of the text, the emotion vector may look like this: [0.1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.2].

Explanation of emotions identified in the text:

- Happiness: Low (0.1) - The overall tone of the text is more introspective and contemplative rather than happy.
- Sadness: High (0.6) - Themes of sadness and introspection are prevalent throughout the text, particularly in lines describing the sad lamb and the burdensome feelings.
- Fear: Moderate (0.5) - The text contains elements that evoke a sense of fear, such as doubts about one's spirit.
- Disgust: Moderate (0.4) - Some descriptions in the text, like the growth of something grotesque and the chains metaphor, can evoke feelings of disgust.
- Anger: Low (0.3) - While there is an underlying sense of inner turmoil, outright anger is not a dominant emotion in the text.
