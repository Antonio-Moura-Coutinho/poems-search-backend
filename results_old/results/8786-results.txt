To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we need to identify and quantify the intensity of each emotion expressed in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the emotions present in the text:

[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0.5, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0.2, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0]

This emotion vector indicates that the text conveys a moderate level of sadness, followed by feelings of bittersweetness, melancholy, and a touch of saudade. The other emotions like happiness, fear, disgust, anger, anticipation, trust, love, awe, and nostalgia are not significantly expressed in the text.
