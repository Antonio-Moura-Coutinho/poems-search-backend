[Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust, Distrust, Love, Saudade, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, Nostalgia]

Analyzing the text, the emotions are as follows:

- Happiness: 0.3

- Fear: 0.2
- Disgust: 0.1
- Anger: 0.2
- Surprise: 0.1

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the text is:

[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.2]
