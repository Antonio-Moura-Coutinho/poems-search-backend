To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, we need to examine the overall tone and underlying emotions conveyed. Here is the emotion vector based on the text provided:

[Happiness: 0.1, Sadness: 0.3, Fear: 0.4, Disgust: 0.6, Anger: 0.4, Surprise: 0.2, Anticipation: 0.3, Trust: 0.2, Distrust: 0.6, Love: 0.1, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.3, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.4, Nostalgia: 0]

In this text, there is a mix of negative emotions such as disgust, fear, and anger as well as elements of sadness, distrust, bittersweetness, and melancholy. The language used is quite chaotic and nonsensical, contributing to a sense of unease and discomfort, leading to a higher intensity of emotions like disgust and fear. The absence of positive emotions like happiness, love, or nostalgia further emphasizes the darker and more unsettling emotional undertones of the text.
