To analyze the emotional content of the text, we can identify various emotions expressed within the text and then output an emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion. Here is an emotion vector based on the emotional content of the text you provided:

[Happiness: 0.0, Sadness: 0.6, Fear: 0.2, Disgust: 0.15, Anger: 0.4, Surprise: 0.1, Anticipation: 0.2, Trust: 0.1, Distrust: 0.2, Love: 0.2, Saudade: 0.1, Awe: 0.0, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.7, Nostalgia: 0.3]

This vector indicates that the text conveys a strong sense of sadness, combined with elements of anger, bittersweetness, melancholy, and some fear and distrust. Love, anticipation, and nostalgia are also present, albeit to a lesser degree. Happiness, surprise, trust, and awe are not prominently featured in this text.
