To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, I will evaluate the text for various emotions based on the provided list. After analyzing the text, I will create an emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1. Let's proceed with the analysis.

Happiness: 0
Sadness: 0.2 (references to fear, dismay, and dying fire)
Fear: 0.3 (mentions of fear, ghosts, and unease)
Disgust: 0
Anger: 0.2 (references to being dismayed and cheeky jests)
Surprise: 0
