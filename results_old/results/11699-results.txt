To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, I will examine the text for emotional cues and assign intensity values for each of the specified emotions. After analyzing the text, the generated emotion vector is:

[0.1, 0.6, 0.6, 0.4, 0.5, 0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.4]

Explanation:
- Happiness: 0.1 - The text portrays more intense feelings of sadness, fear, and other negative emotions rather than happiness.
- Sadness: 0.6 - The text conveys a strong sense of melancholy, grief, and sorrow throughout.
- Fear: 0.6 - There is a recurring theme of fear, anxiety, and uncertainty, particularly in lines such as "Suddenly, the unimaginable needs imagination and finds none."
- Disgust: 0.4 - There are elements that evoke a sense of disgust or disillusionment, such as "Even a god who came here, hearing a sweet voice, would find only old fires now."
- Anger: 0.5 - The text hints at suppressed anger or frustration, reflected in phrases like "I have hidden a cruel, secret ocean in sinews and in sleep and cowardice."
