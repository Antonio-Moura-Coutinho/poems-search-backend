To analyze the emotional content of the text, we can identify various emotions present and assign them intensity values on a scale from 0 to 1. After examining the text, I've compiled the emotion vector below:

[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0.4, Disgust: 0.1, Anger: 0.2, Surprise: 0.2, Anticipation: 0.3, Trust: 0.4, Distrust: 0.2, Love: 0.1, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.3, Bittersweetness: 0.5, Melancholy: 0.4, Nostalgia: 0.5]

This vector represents the intensity of each emotion in the text.
