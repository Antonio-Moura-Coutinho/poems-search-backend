First, let's analyze the emotional content of the text based on the prominent emotions conveyed through the language used. The text seems to convey a sense of admiration, wonder, and reverence towards a higher power or being. There is also a theme of humility and acceptance of one's own limitations compared to the vastness and knowledge of the divine. The language reflects feelings of awe, respect, and acceptance of the mysteries beyond human understanding.

Based on this analysis, we can now create an emotion vector:

[Happiness: 0,
Sadness: 0,
Fear: 0,
Disgust: 0,
Anger: 0,
Surprise: 0,
Anticipation: 0.2, 
Trust: 0.8,
Distrust: 0,
Love: 0.2,
Saudade: 0,
Awe: 0.9,
Bittersweetness: 0,
Melancholy: 0,
Nostalgia: 0]

This emotion vector indicates a higher level of trust, anticipation, and love, along with a strong sense of awe and respect. There are no elements of happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, distrust, saudade, bittersweetness, melancholy, or nostalgia present in the text.
