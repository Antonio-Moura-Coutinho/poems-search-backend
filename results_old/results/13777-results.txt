To analyze the emotional content of the provided text and create an emotion vector, I will first need to identify the predominant emotions present in the text. Based on the text, the emotions detected are:

- Anger
- Disgust
- Anticipation
- Distrust

Now, I will convert these emotions into an emotion vector format as described:

[Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust, Distrust, Love, Saudade, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, Nostalgia]

By assessing the intensity of the detected emotions:

- Happiness: 0
- Sadness: 0
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0.3
- Anger: 0.4
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0.3
- Trust: 0
- Distrust: 0.4
- Love: 0
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0
- Melancholy: 0
- Nostalgia: 0

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the emotional content of the text is:
[0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0, 0.3, 0, 0.4, 0, 0,
