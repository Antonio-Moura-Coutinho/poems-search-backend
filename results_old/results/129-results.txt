To analyze the emotional content of the text, I would interpret the emotions conveyed as follows:

- Sadness: The text conveys a sense of loss, missed opportunities, and a hint of melancholy.
- Fear: There is a feeling of unease and threat, highlighted by references to roaches, drunken cackles, and sirens.
- Anticipation: There is an element of anticipation or expectation, particularly in the lines about missing instructions and the idea of Utopia being close at hand.
- Disgust: The mention of roaches and the general atmosphere of decay could invoke feelings of disgust.
- Awe: The description of the sky tearing open in the north, sirens, and the reflection in the pool could evoke a sense of awe or wonder.
- Melancholy: The overall tone of the text suggests a mix of sadness, introspection, and nostalgia.
- Nostalgia: The references to missed instructions and reflections on the past could evoke feelings of nostalgia.

Based on this analysis, the emotion vector could be estimated as follows: [0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3]. The intensity values are subjective interpretations based on the emotions inferred from the text.
