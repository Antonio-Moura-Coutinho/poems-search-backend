To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will need to identify the emotions expressed in the text. The emotions in the text include elements of Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anticipation, as well as maybe a little Anger and Love. Below is the emotion vector reflecting the intensity of each emotion:

[Sadness: 0.8, Fear: 0.4, Disgust: 0.3, Anger: 0.2, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.5, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.4, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0]
