To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we will need to identify the emotions expressed within the text. Based on the content, the following emotions are present:

- Sadness
- Love
- Awe
- Nostalgia

Since these emotions have varying intensities in the text, we will represent them in a vector format with values ranging from 0 to 1 for each emotion:

[Sadness: 0.6, Love: 0.4, Awe: 0.3, Nostalgia: 0.5, Happiness: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Saudade: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0]

This vector indicates a significant presence of sadness and nostalgia, along with moderate levels of love and awe in the text.
