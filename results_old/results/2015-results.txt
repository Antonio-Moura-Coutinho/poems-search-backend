- Happiness: The description of a little girl being active and adventurous, exploring and having fun, can evoke feelings of happiness.
- Sadness: There is a sense of disappointment or disapproval from the grandmother and possibly the mother, which could elicit a feeling of sadness.
- Anticipation: The little girl's eagerness to explore and her sassy attitude can generate a sense of anticipation for what she may do next.
- Distrust: The line "Why wonâ€™t they let her go?" implies a sense of distrust or suspicion towards the actions of the women taking pictures.
