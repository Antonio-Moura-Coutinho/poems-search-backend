To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, let's break down the emotions expressed in the text:

- Fear: The mention of "Death Star," "icy winds," and "natural disaster" can evoke a sense of fear.
- Anger: The tone of challenging and criticizing "poets" and the idea of charging failure indicate anger.
- Trust: The statement "I look twice to save lives" conveys trust.
- Surprise: The unexpected turn in the text can also evoke surprise.

Based on the analysis, the emotion vector for the text can be estimated as:
[0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

This vector indicates a higher intensity of fear, anger, and trust emotions in the text, reflecting the emotional content expressed.
