To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, I will consider the following emotions:

- Happiness
- Sadness
- Fear
- Disgust
- Anger
- Surprise
- Anticipation
- Trust
- Distrust
- Love
- Saudade
- Awe
- Bittersweetness
- Melancholy
- Nostalgia

After analyzing the text, the emotional vector is as follows:

[0.2, 0.5, 0.3, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.2]

This vector represents the intensity of each emotion in the text on a scale from 0 to 1.
