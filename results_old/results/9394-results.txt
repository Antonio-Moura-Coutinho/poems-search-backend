[Happiness: 0,

Disgust: 0,
Anger: 0,
Surprise: 0,
Anticipation: 0,

Love: 0,
Saudade: 0.1,
Awe: 0.2,
Bittersweetness: 0.5,

Nostalgia: 0.6]

This vector indicates that the text evokes significant feelings of sadness, melancholy, nostalgia, and bittersweetness, with some elements of trust and awe mixed in.
