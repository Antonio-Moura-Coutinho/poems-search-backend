To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we will explore the text and identify the emotions expressed within it. 

Based on the text, we can identify the following emotions and their intensities:

- Happiness: 0
- Sadness: 0.8
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0.5
- Anger: 0.6
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0
- Trust: 0
- Distrust: 0.6
- Love: 0
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0
- Melancholy: 0.8
- Nostalgia: 0

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1 would be:
[0, 0.8, 0, 0.5, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
