To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will examine the underlying emotions present in the text and assign intensity values to each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1. Here is the resulting emotion vector based on the emotional content of the text:

[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 1, Fear: 0.5, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0.5, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.5, Trust: 0.2, Distrust: 0.3, Love: 0, Saudade: 0.1, Awe: 0.6, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 1, Nostalgia: 0.3]

This vector indicates high levels of Sadness, Anger, and Melancholy in the text, along with moderate levels of Fear, Anticipation, and Bittersweetness. Other emotions such as Happiness, Disgust, Surprise, Trust, Love, Distrust, and Nostalgia are relatively low in intensity in this text.
