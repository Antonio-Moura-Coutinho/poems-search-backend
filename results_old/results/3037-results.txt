To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we need to identify the presence and intensity of different emotions within the text. Based on the provided text, here is the emotion vector:

[Happiness: 0.1, Sadness: 0.7, Fear: 0.5, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0.3, Surprise: 0.2, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.5, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.3, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0.3, Melancholy: 0.7, Nostalgia: 0.3]

This vector indicates that the text predominantly conveys emotions of sadness, fear, and anticipation, with moderate levels of trust, anger, and bittersweetness. Other emotions like happiness, surprise, love, and nostalgia are relatively low in intensity, while disgust, distrust, saudade, awe, and melancholy have lower or negligible presence in the text.
