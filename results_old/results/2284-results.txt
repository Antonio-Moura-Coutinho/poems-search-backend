To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, let's first identify the emotions present in the text:

- Anticipation (related to needing help with various issues)
- Frustration (problems mentioned regarding chickens, girl, dog, breasts, best friends, tethering glitches, pricing, setup, etc.)

Based on the identified emotions, we can create an emotion vector based on the intensity of the emotions present in the text:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this vector:
- Anticipation is moderately present (0.6)
- Frustration (Distrust and Anger) is strongly present (0.8)
