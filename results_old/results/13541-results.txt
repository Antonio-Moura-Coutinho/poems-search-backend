Analyzing the emotional content of the text, the emotions that stand out are Anticipation, Trust, and possibly Happiness. There is a sense of positive regard or admiration expressed towards various individuals in the text. Since the text does not strongly convey other emotions like Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Distrust, Love, Saudade, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, or Nostalgia, we can focus on the emotions of Anticipation and Trust as the primary ones. 

Based on this analysis, the emotion vector for the text could be:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector reflects moderate levels of Anticipation and Trust, while the absence of other emotions results in zeros for those categories.
