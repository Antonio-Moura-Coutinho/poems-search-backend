To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions present and their intensities in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the emotional analysis of the text you provided:

[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0.2, Disgust: 0.1, Anger: 0.3, Surprise: 0.1, Anticipation: 0.2, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0.1, Love: 0.1, Saudade: 0.3, Awe: 0.1, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.4, Nostalgia: 0.2]

These values indicate the intensity of each specified emotion in the text, ranging from 0 to 1 for each. The text displays a mix of emotions with higher intensities in sadness, bittersweetness, and melancholy, suggesting a reflective and somewhat somber tone.
