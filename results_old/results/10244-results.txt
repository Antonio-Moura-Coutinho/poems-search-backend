To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will examine the overall tone and implied emotions in the text. The text conveys a sense of urgency, dissatisfaction, and a call to action. There is a feeling of responsibility and guilt for not taking action or addressing important issues. Let's create the emotion vector based on these interpretations:

[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0.6, Fear: 0.2, Disgust: 0.1, Anger: 0.4, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.5, Trust: 0.1, Distrust: 0.3, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0.7, Nostalgia: 0]

This emotion vector indicates a significant presence of sadness, anticipation, and anger, along with feelings of distrust and melancholy in the text.
