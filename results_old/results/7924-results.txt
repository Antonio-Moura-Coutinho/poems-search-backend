To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we'll first need to identify the prevalent emotions in the text. Based on the content, we can see elements of Sadness, Disgust, and Distrust being expressed. Now, we will create an emotion vector based on the intensity of these emotions:

[Sadness: 0.6, Disgust: 0.4, Distrust: 0.7, Happiness: 0, Fear: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0, Nostalgia: 0]

This vector indicates that the text predominantly conveys feelings of sadness, somewhat of disgust, and a strong sense of distrust.
