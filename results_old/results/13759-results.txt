To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions expressed in the text. Based on the analysis, I have generated an emotion vector with varying intensities of different emotions present:

Emotion vector: [0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.3, 0.6, 0, 0.3, 0, 0.4, 0.3, 0]

Explanation:
- Happiness: 0.3 (Moderate level of happiness expressed through the imagery of endless summer and the beauty of nature)
- Sadness: 0.4 (Evident in the melancholic tone, the mention of chill mornings, cracked ground, and the fleeting nature of time)
- Fear: 0.2 (Slight sense of fear hinted at through the whispering birds with nowhere to hide)
- Disgust: 0 (No explicit disgust expressed in the text)
- Anger: 0 (No anger expressed in the text)
- Surprise: 0.5 (Surprise depicted through the unexpected arrival of certain elements like blue plums and the imagery described)
- Anticipation: 0.3 (Anticipation of change or transition suggested in the text)
- Trust: 0.6 (The trust in the cyclical nature of seasons and the comfort in the familiarity of nature)
