To analyze the emotional content of the text and derive an emotion vector, we will need to identify and quantify the emotional intensity in the text. After examining the text, here is the emotion vector:

[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 1, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 1, Melancholy: 1, Nostalgia: 1]

This vector indicates a strong presence of sadness, bittersweetness, melancholy, and nostalgia in the text, while lacking elements of other emotions such as happiness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, anticipation, trust, and distrust.
