I have analyzed the emotional content of the text and generated an emotion vector based on the intensity of each emotion present in the text. Here is the emotion vector for the text you provided: [0, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4, 0.4, 0.3, 0.4, 0, 0.6, 0, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6, 0.6, 0.5].

This emotion vector indicates that the text contains a high level of emotions such as Sadness, Fear, Distrust, Anger, and Melancholy. There are also moderate levels of Disgust, Surprise, Bittersweetness, Nostalgia, and Awe present in the text. Happiness, Trust, Love, and Saudade are not strongly represented in the text.
