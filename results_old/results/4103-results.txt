To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions present in the text and assess their intensity. Based on the text provided, the emotions that stand out are:

- Sadness: expressions like "He droops his sad expressions" and the imagery of Oedipus's crutch suggest sadness.
- Disgust: The mention of "deep-fried ghosts" and "burned rims" could evoke a sense of disgust.
- Awe: The description of the fried ghosts as the sweetest, crispiest, and most intelligent could convey a sense of awe.

With these emotions in mind, the emotion vector could look like this:

[0, 0.5, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0]

This vector indicates a significant presence of sadness, some disgust, and hints of awe in the text.
