To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will interpret the predominant emotions conveyed in the text. Based on the provided text, we can identify the following emotions and their intensities:

- Happiness: 0.2
- Sadness: 0.4
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0
- Anger: 0
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0.2
- Trust: 0.4
- Distrust: 0
- Love: 0.2
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0.4
- Bittersweetness: 0.4

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1 would be: [0.2, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0, 0.2, 0, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4].
