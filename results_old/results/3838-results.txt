To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, I will identify the emotions conveyed in the text and assign a score representing the intensity of each emotion. Here is the emotion vector based on the emotional analysis of the text:

[Happiness: 0.8, Sadness: 0.1, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.3, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.9, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.6, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.6, Bittersweetness: 0.2, Melancholy: 0.1, Nostalgia: 0.5]

This emotion vector indicates that the text conveys high levels of Happiness, Trust, Love, Awe, and Nostalgia, along with moderate levels of Surprise and Anticipation, while displaying lower levels of Bittersweetness and Melancholy. There are minimal traces of Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, and Distrust in the emotional content of the text.
