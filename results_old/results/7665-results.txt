To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we have to identify and weigh the intensity of different emotions present in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the emotional content of the text:

[Happiness: 0.7, Sadness: 0.3, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.8, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.7, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.6, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.3, Nostalgia: 0.5]

The text predominantly conveys happiness, trust, and love with elements of anticipation, awe, and nostalgia, along with a slight touch of sadness and bittersweetness. Other emotions like fear, disgust, anger, and distrust are not significantly present in the text.
