To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will need to identify keywords and phrases that evoke specific emotions. 

Based on the text provided, we can identify the following emotional content:

- Sadness: "darkens into evening", "dark is darker than any he has known", "feels something forming within him", "confess to again and again"
- Fear: "the dark is darker than any he has known", "the room seems to close around him", "something forming within him without being sure what it is"
- Anticipation: "waits while the room seems to close around him", "as if a story were about to unfold"

Using this analysis, we can generate an emotion vector:

[0, 0.5, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector indicates a high intensity of sadness, a moderate level of fear, and a moderate level of anticipation in the text provided.
