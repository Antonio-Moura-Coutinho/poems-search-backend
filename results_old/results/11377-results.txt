To analyze the emotional content of the text and construct an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions present and assess their intensity. From the text, we can gather that the predominant emotions include Nostalgia, Love, Melancholy, and possibly Anticipation.

Based on the text, here is an emotion vector representing the intensity of emotions on a scale from 0 to 1:

[Nostalgia: 0.7, Love: 0.6, Melancholy: 0.5, Anticipation: 0.4, Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0]

This emotion vector indicates a higher intensity of Nostalgia and Love, followed by Melancholy and a moderate level of Anticipation. Other emotions such as Happiness, Sadness, Fear, and others are not significantly expressed in the text.
