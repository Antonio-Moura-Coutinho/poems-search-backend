To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions expressed in the text and their respective intensity. Here's the emotion vector based on the text provided:

[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0.3, Fear: 0.4, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0, Nostalgia: 0]

The text conveys a sense of fear and sadness, as indicated by the references to fear, risk-aversion, and choosing someone else over oneself. There is a feeling of limitation and a lack of positive emotions such as happiness or love. The overall tone is somewhat introspective and contemplative.
