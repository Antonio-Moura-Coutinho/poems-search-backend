To analyze the emotional content of the text and create the emotion vector, we need to consider the feelings and themes conveyed:

- Happiness: Absent
- Sadness: Present (mention of Pain, Sorrow, Death)
- Fear: Present (references to Death)
- Disgust: Present (Sins, Hate)
- Anger: Absent
- Surprise: Absent
- Anticipation: Present (uncertainty implied by "Peradventure")

- Saudade: Absent
- Awe: Present (references to Desire, Pleasure, and Death)

Based on the analysis, the emotion vector for the text would be: [0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.3, 0]
