To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to examine the prevalent emotions in the text. Based on the text provided, the emotional intensity for each emotion is as follows:

[Happiness: 0.3, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0.3, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.2, Anticipation: 0.3, Trust: 0.4, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.6, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.5, Nostalgia: 0.2]

Thus, the emotion vector for the text is:
[0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.2]
