To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to identify the prevalent emotions expressed.

The text conveys feelings of sadness, sorrow, empathy, grief, and a sense of loss. There's a melancholic tone as it describes the burial of somebody's baby and the profound sorrow experienced by the unknown mother. The imagery of a white hearse, soft little hands crossed over the breast, and the finality of death evokes a strong emotional response.

Based on the emotional content of the text, the emotion vector could be:

[0, 0.8, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This represents a high intensity of sadness, some level of fear, and no significant presence of other specific emotions.
