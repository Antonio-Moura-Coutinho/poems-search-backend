To analyze the emotional content of the text, we can identify the following emotions:

- Happiness: The text primarily conveys happiness through the actions of the tree frogs singing happily.
- Trust: There is an element of trust portrayed when Coqu√≠ doesn't push or bite his brother but instead communicates with him.

Using this analysis, we can construct an emotion vector that reflects the intensity of happiness and trust in the text:

[Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust, Distrust, Love, Saudade, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, Nostalgia]

The emotion vector would be:

[0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector indicates a high level of happiness and a moderate level of trust portrayed in the text.
