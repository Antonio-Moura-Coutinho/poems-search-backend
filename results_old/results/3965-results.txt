To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will assess the intensity of each emotion present. After examining the text, the following emotion vector has been created:

[0.2, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6, 0.4, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.5]

This vector suggests a moderate level of sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, anticipation, distrust, and nostalgia in the text. It also indicates a low level of happiness, trust, bittersweetness, and melancholy.
