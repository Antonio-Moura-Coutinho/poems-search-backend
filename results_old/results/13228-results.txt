To analyze the emotional content of the text and output the emotion vector, we need to identify the prominent emotions and their respective intensities in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the analysis:

[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0.2, Surprise: 0.2, Anticipation: 0.1, Trust: 0.6, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.5, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.4, Bittersweetness: 0.3, Melancholy: 0.4, Nostalgia: 0.1]

This vector indicates that the text predominantly conveys emotions of sadness, anger, awe, love, and melancholy, with varying intensities ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 for each emotion.
