To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we can identify the emotions expressed in the text and assess their intensity. 

Applying the Emotion Semantic Model (ESM) to the text, we can assign the following emotional intensities to the emotions specified:

- Happiness: 0.1
- Sadness: 0.4
- Fear: 0.2
- Disgust: 0.1
- Anger: 0.0
- Surprise: 0.2
- Anticipation: 0.2
- Trust: 0.1
- Distrust: 0.1
- Love: 0.1
- Saudade: 0.0
- Awe: 0.1
- Bittersweetness: 0.1
- Melancholy: 0.3
- Nostalgia: 0.2

The resulting emotion vector for the text is: [0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2]
