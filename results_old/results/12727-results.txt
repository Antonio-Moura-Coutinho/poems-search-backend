To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector based on the provided list of emotions, we need to assess the predominant emotions conveyed in the text. After analyzing the text, the emotions that stand out most are:

- Sadness: The imagery of battle, destruction, and loss conveys a sense of sadness.
- Fear: The tension and unpredictability of the battlefield setting evoke a feeling of fear.
- Disgust: The imagery of the stricken flower and the impact of violence could elicit a sense of disgust.

Based on this analysis, the emotion vector for the text could be:

[0, 0.6, 0.6, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector indicates a high intensity of sadness, fear, and disgust in the text, while other emotions are not as prominent.
