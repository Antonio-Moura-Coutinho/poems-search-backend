To analyze the emotional content of the given text and output an emotion vector, we will examine the text for various emotions and determine their intensity. Based on the text, the emotions present and their intensities are as follows:

- Happiness: 0
- Sadness: 0.8
- Fear: 0.3
- Disgust: 0
- Anger: 0
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0
- Trust: 0
- Distrust: 0
- Love: 0
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0
- Melancholy: 0.9
- Nostalgia: 0.5

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1 would be: [0, 0.8, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5].
