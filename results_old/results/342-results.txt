I have analyzed the emotional content of the text you provided and calculated the emotion vector based on the intensity of each emotion present. The emotion vector for the text is as follows: 

[0, 0.4, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.3, 0]

This vector indicates a relatively high presence of emotions such as Sadness, Fear, Trust, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, and Nostalgia. Feelings of sadness, fear, and nostalgia are particularly prominent in the text, while emotions like Trust, Awe, Bittersweetness, and Melancholy are also quite notable.
