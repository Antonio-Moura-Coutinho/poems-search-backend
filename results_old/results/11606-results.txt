To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, let's break down the emotions expressed in the text and assign intensity values for each emotion.

- Happiness: 0
- Sadness: 0.4
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0.2
- Anger: 0.4
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0
- Trust: 0
- Distrust: 0.3
- Love: 0.2
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0
- Melancholy: 0.5
- Nostalgia: 0

The resulting emotion vector based on the provided emotional intensities would be: [0, 0.4, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0].
