To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we can break down the text and identify the emotions expressed within it.

Emotional analysis of the text:
- Fear: Fear is evident in phrases like "our minds shut" and "we wouldn't have resisted anything but the truth."
- Surprise: Surprise is apparent with descriptions like "revelation" and the unexpected turn of events.
- Anticipation: Anticipation can be seen in the buildup of suspense as the characters wait for something more after the revelation.
- Distrust: Distrust is implied by the mention of the mime's "unpleasant remarks" and the realization that she wasn't a real mime.

Based on the emotional analysis, the emotion vector for the text could be:
[0, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.3, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector represents a higher intensity of fear, surprise, anticipation, and distrust in the text, while other emotions are not as strongly expressed.
