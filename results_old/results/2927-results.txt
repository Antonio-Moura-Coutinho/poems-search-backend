To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to identify and quantify the emotions expressed in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the emotional analysis of the text:

[Happiness: 0.6, Sadness: 0.3, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.1, Anticipation: 0.1, Trust: 0.8, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.7, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.5, Bittersweetness: 0.7, Melancholy: 0.4, Nostalgia: 0.4]

This emotion vector indicates that the text conveys a mix of emotions, with higher levels of happiness, trust, love, bittersweetness, and awe, while also containing elements of sadness, surprise, anticipation, and a hint of melancholy and nostalgia.
