To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, let's break down the emotions conveyed in the text:

- Happiness: There is a sense of nostalgia and reminiscing about the past, but it is not necessarily a joyful or happy nostalgia.
- Sadness: There is a hint of sadness in the text, particularly in the reference to conversations ending in silence.
- Fear: There is no direct indication of fear in the text.
- Disgust: There is mention of engineered trees and a sense of artificiality, but not necessarily disgust.
- Anger: There is no explicit anger in the text.
- Surprise: There is no surprise mentioned.
- Anticipation: There is a sense of anticipation or expectancy, especially with the reference to things being presented in a different light.
- Trust: There is no direct indication of trust.
- Distrust: There is a slight sense of skepticism or questioning implied by phrases like "constellations of stickers glow from bedroom ceilings."

Based on the emotional analysis above, the emotion vector for the text could be estimated as follows:
[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.3, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0.3, Love: 0, Saudade: 0.3, Awe: 0,
