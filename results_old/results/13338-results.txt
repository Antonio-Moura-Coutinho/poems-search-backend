To analyze the emotional content, I will break down the text and identify the emotions expressed:

Happiness: The text conveys a light and playful tone, especially when describing the birds and the perspective of the speaker towards worms and food.
Anticipation: There is a sense of anticipation or curiosity when the speaker puts the worm on their tongue, wondering about the taste.
Disgust: The mention of putting a worm on the tongue and the reaction to the taste implies a feeling of disgust.
Surprise: The revelation that the speaker did not swallow the worm may invoke a sense of surprise.

Based on this analysis, the emotion vector for the text could be: [0.4, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

This vector indicates a moderate level of happiness and anticipation, higher levels of disgust and distrust, a slight element of surprise, and a small sense of love intertwined with the overall emotions expressed in the text.
