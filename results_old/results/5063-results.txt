To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we will need to identify and quantify the intensity of each emotion present in the text. Based on the text provided, we can determine the following emotional intensities:

- Happiness: 0.2
- Sadness: 0.7
- Fear: 0.3
- Disgust: 0.1
- Anger: 0.4
- Surprise: 0.1
- Anticipation: 0.3
- Trust: 0.5
- Distrust: 0.2
- Love: 0.1
- Saudade: 0.0
- Awe: 0.1
- Bittersweetness: 0.6 
- Melancholy: 0.7
- Nostalgia: 0.4

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the intensities of the emotions in the text is:

[0.2, 0.7, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.6, 0.7, 0.4]
