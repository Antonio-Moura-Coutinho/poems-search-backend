To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, we need to consider the emotions suggested by the imagery and context of the words. Here is an emotion vector that represents the intensity of each emotion in the text:

[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.3, Fear: 0.4, Disgust: 0.4, Anger: 0.2, Surprise: 0.2, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0.3, Love: 0.3, Saudade: 0.1, Awe: 0.2, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.3, Nostalgia: 0.1]

The text suggests a mix of emotions with elements of fear, disgust, anticipation, and bittersweetness being the most prominent. The imagery of alley cats in the kitchen, weeping god, and slipping hallucinogens contribute to these emotions. Hope this analysis helps!
