To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we need to identify the key emotions expressed in the text. Here is an analysis of the emotional content of the text along with the corresponding emotion vector:

Happiness - 0
Sadness - 0.6
Fear - 0
Disgust - 0
Anger - 0
Surprise - 0
Anticipation - 0
Trust - 0.2
Distrust - 0
Love - 0
Saudade - 0
Awe - 0
Bittersweetness - 0.8
Melancholy - 0.9
Nostalgia - 0.6

The emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion would be: [0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0.9, 0.6]

This vector indicates a high level of sadness, bittersweetness, and melancholy in the text, along with some elements of trust and nostalgia.
