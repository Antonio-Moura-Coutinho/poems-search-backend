To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, I will identify the emotions expressed and their intensity in the text:

Happiness: 0  
Sadness: 0.6  
Fear: 0  
Disgust: 0  
Anger: 0  
Surprise: 0  
Anticipation: 0  
Trust: 0  
Distrust: 0.6  
Love: 0  
Saudade: 0  
Awe: 0  
Bittersweetness: 0.4  
Melancholy: 0.8  
Nostalgia: 0  

Based on the analysis of the text, the emotion vector representing the intensity of emotions would be:  
[0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.8, 0]
