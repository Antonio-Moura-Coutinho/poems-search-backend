To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, I will identify the primary emotions expressed:

- Anticipation: The text conveys a sense of anticipation and mystery as the writer explores their thoughts and experiences.
- Awe: The language used evokes a feeling of wonder and reverence towards the unknown and the poetic.
- Melancholy: There is a tone of melancholy and introspection as the writer reflects on their existence and the contrast between their poetic world and the mundane reality.

Based on the emotional analysis, the emotion vector would be as follows:

[0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.5, 0]

This vector indicates that the text is primarily associated with emotions such as Anticipation, Trust, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, and Nostalgia, with lower intensities of Fear, Surprise, and Happiness.
