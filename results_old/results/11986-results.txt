Based on the text "After Stevens," "It was when he said expansively There is no such thing as the truth," the emotional content seems to convey a sense of philosophical reflection and ambiguity rather than explicit emotional tones. However, we can still analyze the text for underlying emotional nuances.

Emotion vector analysis:
[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.2, Anticipation: 0.5, Trust: 0.4, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0, Nostalgia: 0]

In this analysis, the text conveys a moderate level of Anticipation and Trust, indicating an expectation and openness towards the philosophical statement mentioned. There is a slight element of Surprise, possibly triggered by the provocative nature of the assertion. The absence of other intense emotional markers suggests a more contemplative and intellectual tone rather than a strongly emotional one.
