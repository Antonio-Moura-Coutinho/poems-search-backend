To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we can identify the intensity of the emotions conveyed. The text displays a mix of introspective contemplation, sensory experiences, physical sensations, and a sense of longing or missing someone.

Based on the content, the emotion vector could be as follows:

[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.1, Anticipation: 0.3, Trust: 0.2, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.3, Saudade: 0.4, Awe: 0.1, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.4, Nostalgia: 0.3]

This vector reflects a blend of sadness, anticipation, trust, love, bittersweetness, melancholy, and nostalgia in varying degrees throughout the text.
