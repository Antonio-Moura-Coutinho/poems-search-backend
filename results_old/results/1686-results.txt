To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we first need to identify the prevalent emotions conveyed in the text. Based on the text provided, we can infer the following emotions:

- Sadness: The mention of death, lone ship, rain not safe to drink, new explosions, mass grave, and cold January air suggests a sense of sadness.
- Fear: The presence of explosions, the idea of history shuddering, and rain not being safe to drink evoke a feeling of fear.
- Melancholy: The descriptions of unattended roses, thorns at the edge of a mass grave, and the general atmospheric tone suggest a melancholic mood.

Given the analysis, the emotion vector for the text would be as follows:

[0, 0.6, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0]

The values in the vector represent the intensity of each emotion listed earlier on a scale from 0 to 1. Feel free to reach out if you need any further assistance.
