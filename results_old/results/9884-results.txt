To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions conveyed in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the intensity of emotions present in the text:

[0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.6, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0.7, 0.4, 0]

This vector indicates the intensity of various emotions present in the text. Trust and love are the dominant emotions, followed by happiness, anticipation, bittersweetness, and nostalgia, while other emotions like sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, distrust, saudade, awe, and melancholy are not strongly expressed in the text.
