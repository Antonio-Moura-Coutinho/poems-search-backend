To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions expressed in the text and assign intensity values to each emotion. Based on the text provided, here is the emotion vector:

[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.2, Trust: 0.4, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.2, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.6, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0.4]

This emotion vector indicates that the text conveys a mix of emotions with higher intensities in sadness, trust, bittersweetness, melancholy, and nostalgia. The emotions of happiness, anticipation, love, and awe are also present but to a lesser degree.
