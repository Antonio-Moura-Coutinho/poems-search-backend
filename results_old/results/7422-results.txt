To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, let's first identify the emotions present in the text and then assess the intensity of each emotion. Based on the text, we can detect the following emotions and their intensities:

Happiness: 0.35
Sadness: 0.2
Fear: 0
Disgust: 0
Anger: 0.15
Surprise: 0
Anticipation: 0.55
Trust: 0.45
Distrust: 0
Love: 0.1
Saudade: 0
Awe: 0
Bittersweetness: 0.35
Melancholy: 0
Nostalgia: 0.3

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the emotional content of the text is approximately:

[0.35, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.15, 0, 0.55, 0.45, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0.3]
