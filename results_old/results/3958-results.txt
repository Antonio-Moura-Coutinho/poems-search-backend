To analyze the emotional content of the text, we will identify the emotions and their intensity within the text. Based on the provided text, the emotions expressed are:

- **Sadness**: The text contains elements of loss, remembrance of the past, and a sense of fading memory.
- **Anticipation**: There is a sense of looking back at the past and anticipating changes that have occurred over time.
- **Disgust**: The line "the people who hung you as their ikon against the long passage wall are underground" may evoke a sense of disgust or unease.

Based on the identified emotions, I will calculate the emotion vector. 

The vector will be normalized to represent the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1.

Calculating the emotion vector:

- **Sadness**: Moderately expressed throughout the text. (0.6)
- **Anticipation**: Slightly expressed. (0.2)
- **Disgust**: Slightly expressed. (0.1)

Therefore, the emotion vector for the text is: [0, 0.6, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
