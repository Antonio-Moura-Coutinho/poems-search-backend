To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, we can identify the following emotions:

- Happiness: The text conveys happiness through phrases like "And weren't we gentle and awed and afraid" and "And weren't we lovely."
- Love: The text expresses love through references to the sweetness shared between the individuals.
- Awe: The text conveys awe through phrases like "weren't we gentle and awed and afraid" and "were we not lovely, then, were we not as lovely as thunder, and damp grass, and flame?"

Based on these emotional cues, the emotion vector for the text could be:

[0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.6, 0, 0.6, 0, 0]

This vector indicates a moderate level of happiness, love, awe, trust, bittersweetness, and a combination of saudade and nostalgia in the text.
