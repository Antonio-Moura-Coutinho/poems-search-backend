To analyze the emotional content of the text, we can identify the emotions expressed and determine their intensity. In this poem, the emotions conveyed include:

- Sadness: The mention of a corpse being carried from the house and the lilies rotting implies a sense of sadness and loss.
- Fear: The image of a corpse being carried and the mystery of the situation can evoke fear.
- Anticipation: The repeated knocking on the door and the mention of the closed door build anticipation and suspense.

Based on these emotions, we can create an emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion:

[Sadness: 0.8, Fear: 0.6, Anticipation: 0.5, Happiness: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0, Nostalgia: 0]

This vector indicates a high level of sadness and fear, with a moderate level of anticipation present in the text.
