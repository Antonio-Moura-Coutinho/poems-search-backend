To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we will need to identify the emotions conveyed in the text and assign intensity values to each based on the given scale. After analyzing the text, here is the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion:

[Happiness: 0.1, Sadness: 0.6, Fear: 0.1, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.1, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.2, Saudade: 0.3, Awe: 0.1, Bittersweetness: 0.5, Melancholy: 0.7, Nostalgia: 0.6]

This vector indicates that the text conveys higher intensities of sadness, bittersweetness, melancholy, and nostalgia, while also containing elements of anticipation, trust, love, and saudade.
