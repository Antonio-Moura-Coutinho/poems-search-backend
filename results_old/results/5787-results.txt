To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we can identify the predominant emotions portrayed:

- Sadness: The text expresses feelings of tiredness, obscurity, yearning for avoidance, fear, silence, and memories fading. These elements indicate a predominant sense of sadness.

- Fear: There are references to eyes averted in fear, accented by a sense of obscurity and the unknown.

- Disgust: The text touches upon the idea of remaining obscure, challenges with self-identification, and a detachment from surroundings which could reflect a hint of disgust.

- Melancholy: The overall tone and themes of loneliness, obscurity, memories fading, and silent landscapes evoke a sense of melancholy.

Given the analysis of emotions in the text, the emotion vector could look approximately like this: [0.1, 0.7, 0.4, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0].
