Analyzing the emotional content of the text, we observe multiple emotions being expressed:

- Anticipation: The act of opening a long unopened book and wondering about the odor, genie, spirit, and dark spell broken indicates a sense of anticipation.
- Nostalgia: References to the father's notes in the margins and the mention of "The Dry Salvages" evoke feelings of nostalgia.
- Awe: The sense of wonder and mystery surrounding the opening of the book suggests an element of awe.

Based on these observations, here is an emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0.6, 0.5]

Please note that the values in the vector are subjective assessments and can vary depending on individual interpretations.
