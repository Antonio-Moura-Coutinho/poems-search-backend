To analyze the emotional content of the text, we'll identify keywords and phrases that convey emotions and then assign intensity values to each emotion based on the text.

Based on the text, here is the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1:

[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0.5, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0.5, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.5, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0.5, Nostalgia: 0]

Emotional analysis:
- Sadness (0.5): The speaker expresses a sense of not wanting to conform to the expectations and desires of the world, suggesting a feeling of discord or dissatisfaction.
- Anger (0.5): The text conveys a rejection of societal norms and values, indicating a rebellious or defiant attitude.
- Love (0.5): The mention of Saint Francis and his love for animals suggests a longing for a different kind of connection and compassion.
