To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, let's break down the emotions conveyed in the text:

- Sadness: The text conveys a sense of sadness with the depiction of soldiers dying in battle and the somber imagery of wooden crosses marking their places.

- Fear: The fear is implied through phrases like "Soldiers pitch and cough and twitch" and "Choking through the whole attack," indicating the distress and danger the soldiers are facing.

- Anger: There is a hint of anger in the text, especially through the imagery of soldiers struggling and dying in battle, which can evoke feelings of frustration and anger towards the circumstances of war.

- Anticipation: The anticipation of impending danger and the chaos of battle can be felt in the text as the soldiers face the brutal reality of warfare.

Based on these emotional cues, we can construct the emotion vector:

[0, 0.6, 0.5, 0, 0.4, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0]

This vector indicates a high intensity of sadness, fear, and anticipation, along with some level of anger, bittersweetness, and melancholy in the text.
