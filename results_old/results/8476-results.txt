To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to identify the emotions conveyed in the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the analysis:

[Happiness: 0.1, Sadness: 0.2, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0.4, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.2, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0.2, Nostalgia: 0]

This vector indicates a higher intensity of anger and some sadness and melancholy present in the text, along with feelings of anticipation and trust.
