To analyze the emotional content of the text and create the emotion vector, I will highlight the emotions present in the text:

- Anticipation: The text describes Argyle talking to himself on his way to the "corpse's obsequies," creating a sense of anticipation.
- Trust: Argyle appears to trust his own abilities and intelligence to carry out his duties as a sin-eater.
- Love: The mention of Eve and the memory of a woman's company evoke feelings of love and connection.
- Awe: The description of the relationship between words such as grace, gratis, gratitude, and closeness like cousins singing the same tune evokes a sense of awe.

Based on these emotions, the emotion vector could be represented as:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.3, 0, 0.2, 0, 0.2, 0, 0]

This vector reflects the presence of anticipation, trust, love, and awe in the text.
