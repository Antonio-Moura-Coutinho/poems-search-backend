To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to examine the overall tone and underlying emotions conveyed in the text.

Emotional analysis of the text reveals the following intensities for each emotion:

Happiness: 0
Sadness: 0.25
Fear: 0.2
Disgust: 0.2
Anger: 0.2
Surprise: 0
Anticipation: 0.2
Trust: 0
Distrust: 0
Love: 0
Saudade: 0
Awe: 0
Bittersweetness: 0.4
Melancholy: 0.4
Nostalgia: 0.5

Based on the emotional analysis, the emotion vector representing the intensities of each emotion would be:
[0, 0.25, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.4, 0.5]
