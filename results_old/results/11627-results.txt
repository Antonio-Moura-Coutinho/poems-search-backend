To analyze the emotional content of the text, we can detect various emotions portrayed in the text and measure their intensities to construct an emotion vector. 

The emotions detected in the text are as follows:
- Sadness: The imagery of a stubborn door-latch, a beast, a withering plant, a crying child, and the mention of snow coming on evoke a sense of melancholy and sadness.
- Fear: The description of a beast behind a stubborn door-latch and the unknown presence of someone walking can evoke a sense of fear.
- Anticipation: The description of the unknown who is walking and the anticipation of snow coming on can evoke a sense of anticipation.

Based on the detected emotions, the emotion vector could be:
[0, 0.5, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0]
