To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, it is important to identify the prevalent emotions throughout the text. Based on the content of the text, the following emotions are present:

- Fear: Descriptions of ominous events and unusual occurrences may evoke feelings of fear.
- Surprise: The unexpected appearance of the broken end of a picture frame as opposed to the ark symbolizes an element of surprise.
- Anticipation: There is a sense of anticipation and mystery surrounding the events described, especially with the introduction of fantastical creatures and cryptic references.
- Trust: The interaction between the narrator and the brother implies a level of trust or reliance on the brother's knowledge and intentions.

Based on these emotional elements, the emotion vector could be represented as follows:

[0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 0, 0.3, 0, 0.4, 0, 0]

This vector indicates a moderate level of anticipation, surprise, trust, and awe, with low levels of fear and mixed emotions like sadness or love.
