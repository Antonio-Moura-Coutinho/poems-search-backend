To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we need to examine the text for underlying emotions and their intensities. Based on the provided text, the emotions present are as follows:

Happiness: 0.2
Sadness: 0.3
Fear: 0
Disgust: 0.1
Anger: 0.2
Surprise: 0
Anticipation: 0.3
Trust: 0.4
Distrust: 0.1
Love: 0.2
Saudade: 0
Awe: 0
Bittersweetness: 0.2
Melancholy: 0.3
Nostalgia: 0.4

Thus, the emotion vector representing the intensities of various emotions in the text would be:

[0.2, 0.3, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
