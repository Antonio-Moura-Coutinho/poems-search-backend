To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will look at the key emotions expressed in the text:

1. Sadness: The text conveys a sense of nostalgia, missed opportunities, and longing, which are indicative of sadness.
2. Anticipation: There is a feeling of anticipation and unfulfilled potential in the descriptions of what could have been.
3. Love: The relationship between the narrator and their mother is depicted with love and wistfulness.
4. Melancholy: The overall tone of the text reflects a deep sense of melancholy and reflection on the past.
5. Nostalgia: The descriptions of past memories and the yearning to relive them evoke nostalgia.

Based on the emotions identified in the text, the emotion vector could be represented as follows:
[Sadness: 0.5, Anticipation: 0.4, Love: 0.3, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0.7]

This vector quantifies the intensity of each emotion present in the text, with higher values indicating a stronger presence of that particular emotion.
