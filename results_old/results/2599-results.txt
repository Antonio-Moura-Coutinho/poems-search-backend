To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, we need to identify the dominant emotions and their intensity in the text. Based on the text provided, we can detect the following emotions:

- Sadness: The sense of loss, soul-dizzying woe, and finding the Throne empty evoke sadness.
- Anticipation: There is anticipation and longing in the phrases like "History is being made" and "These are the things that are worth while."

Using this analysis, we can create an emotion vector for the text:

[0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector indicates a high intensity of sadness and a moderate intensity of anticipation in the text, while other emotions are not prominently expressed.
