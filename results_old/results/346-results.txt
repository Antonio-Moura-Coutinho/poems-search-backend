To analyze the emotional content of the text and generate an emotion vector, we can identify and quantify the emotions expressed within the text. Here is the emotion vector based on the emotional analysis of the text you provided:

[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0.3, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0.6, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.2, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.7, Nostalgia: 0]

This emotion vector indicates the intensity of each emotion present in the text on a scale from 0 to 1 for the specified emotions. The text predominantly conveys emotions such as sadness, anger, trust, bittersweetness, and melancholy.
