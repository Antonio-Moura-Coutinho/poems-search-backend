Based on the emotional content of the text, the emotion vector could be as follows: 

[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.1, Trust: 0.5, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0, Nostalgia: 0]

The text seems to convey a sense of trust towards the man initially, as the mother of Jesus asks for a needle, but he responds in a different way than expected by offering a discourse instead. There is a subtle element of anticipation as the reader wonders how the situation will unfold, but overall, the emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, love, saudade, awe, bittersweetness, melancholy, and nostalgia are not strongly present in this excerpt.
