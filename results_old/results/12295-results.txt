To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, I will evaluate the emotional themes present in the text and assign intensity values to each emotion based on the predominant emotions conveyed.

Emotional vector:
[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.5, Fear: 0.1, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.2, Anticipation: 0.3, Trust: 0.2, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0.4]

Explanation:
- Happiness: Low intensity as the tone of the text is more reflective and contemplative rather than joyful.
- Sadness: High intensity, as there is a sense of melancholy and somberness present in the imagery of the changing seasons and the missing farmer.
- Fear: Low intensity, hinted at by the mention of the missing farmer, but not a dominant emotion.
- Disgust: Not detected in the text.
- Anger: Not detected in the text.
- Surprise: Moderate intensity, with elements such as the unexpected appearance of the farmer's body and the sudden shift from spring to darkness.
- Anticipation: Moderate intensity, as the text describes the anticipation of spring turning into a brief and transient experience.
