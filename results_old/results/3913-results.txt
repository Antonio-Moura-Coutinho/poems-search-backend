To analyze the emotional content of the text, we can identify the following emotions:

- Sadness: The text conveys a sense of sadness, melancholy, grief, and pity as it describes the gradual weakening of the will, fading of brightness, lack of good to touch, and the sick falling from earth.
- Disgust: There is an element of disgust in the depiction of corrupt and unsubstantial aspects, as well as the description of pulverous grief and the melting of bones with pity.

Based on the identified emotions, the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion can be approximated as follows: 

[Sadness: 0.8, Disgust: 0.4, Happiness: 0, Fear: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0, Trust: 0, Distrust: 0, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0.7, Nostalgia: 0]

This vector emphasizes the strong presence of sadness and a moderate level of disgust, with low levels or absence of other emotions.
