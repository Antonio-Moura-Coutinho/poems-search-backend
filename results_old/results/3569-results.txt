To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will look for keywords and phrases that indicate specific emotions. Based on the text provided, here is the emotion vector:

[Happiness: 0.3, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0.1, Disgust: 0.1, Anger: 0.1, Surprise: 0.1, Anticipation: 0.5, Trust: 0.6, Distrust: 0.2, Love: 0.3, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0.4, Nostalgia: 0.3]

This vector indicates a moderate level of sadness, anticipation, trust, love, nostalgia, and melancholy in the text, with lower levels of happiness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and distrust. There are no explicit mentions of emotions like Saudade, Awe, or Bittersweetness in the text, so these are represented as 0 in the vector.
