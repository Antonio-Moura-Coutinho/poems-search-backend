To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we can identify the following emotions present in varying intensities:

- Happiness: 0.1
- Sadness: 0.6
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0
- Anger: 0
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0.1
- Trust: 0.4
- Distrust: 0
- Love: 0.3
- Saudade: 0.2
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0.3
- Melancholy: 0.5
- Nostalgia: 0.4

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion in the text is:

[0.1, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.4, 0, 0.3, 0.2, 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.4]
