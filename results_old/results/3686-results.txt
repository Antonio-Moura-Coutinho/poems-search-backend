Analyzing the emotional content of the text, we can identify the following emotions and their intensities on a scale from 0 to 1:

[Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust, Distrust, Love, Saudade, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, Nostalgia]

Based on the text, the emotion vector could be:

[0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0.3, 0]

Please note that analyzing emotions from a text is subjective, and different interpretations may lead to slightly different emotion vectors.
