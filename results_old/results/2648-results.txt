To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we can identify the prominent emotions displayed throughout the text. Here is a breakdown of the emotions and their intensities:

- Happiness: 0.4
- Sadness: 0.3
- Fear: 0
- Disgust: 0
- Anger: 0.1
- Surprise: 0
- Anticipation: 0.2
- Trust: 0.7
- Distrust: 0
- Love: 0.5
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0.3
- Bittersweetness: 0.4
- Melancholy: 0.4

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the emotional content of the text would be: [0.4, 0.3, 0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0.2, 0.7, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3].
