To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will consider the overall tone and themes present in the text. The text seems to convey a mix of mystical, cultural, and historical imagery related to nature, sea, saints, and ancient traditions. There are elements of wonder, reverence, connection to the natural world, and perhaps a sense of nostalgia and mystery.

Based on this analysis, we can estimate the emotion vector as follows:

[Happiness: 0.3, Sadness: 0.2, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.3, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.6, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.5, Saudade: 0.3, Awe: 0.6, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.3, Nostalgia: 0.4]

This emotion vector indicates that the text evokes feelings of anticipation, trust, love, awe, bittersweetness, and nostalgia, with slight touches of happiness, sadness, and surprise. Feel free to adjust the values based on your interpretation of the text.
