To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we'll need to identify key emotional cues in the text. Based on the text provided, the emotions present include:

- Fear
- Disgust
- Sadness
- Anticipation

Calculating the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1:

- Fear: The fear is portrayed through elements like the dark clouds, the implication of danger, and the discomfort of riding with a stranger. Intensity: 0.6
- Disgust: The feeling of disgust is evoked through the imagery of sewer pipes bursting and bile at the back of the throat. Intensity: 0.7
- Sadness: The sadness is implied through the melancholic tone and the sense of unease. Intensity: 0.4
- Anticipation: There is an undercurrent of anticipation or suspense in the text, especially as the situation with the driver unfolds. Intensity: 0.3

Based on these emotional assessments, the emotion vector for the text would be: [0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
