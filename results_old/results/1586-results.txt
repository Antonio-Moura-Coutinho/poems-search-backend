To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we'll need to examine the different emotions conveyed in the poem. Based on the text, here is the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion:

[Happiness: 0.4, Sadness: 0.4, Fear: 0.2, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0.2, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.6, Distrust: 0.2, Love: 0.6, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.6, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0.4]

This vector suggests that the text evokes a range of emotions, with a higher focus on trust, love, awe, melancholy, and anticipation. There are elements of sadness, fear, and a hint of anger, but overall, the emotions of trust, love, and awe stand out more prominently in the piece.
