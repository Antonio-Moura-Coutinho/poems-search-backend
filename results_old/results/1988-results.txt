To analyze the emotional content of the text and provide an emotion vector, I will assess the predominant emotions expressed in the text. Based on the content, the emotions present and their intensity are as follows:

[Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust, Distrust, Love, Saudade, Awe, Bittersweetness, Melancholy, Nostalgia]

Here is the emotion vector for the provided text:

[0.13, 0.42, 0.07, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, 0.03, 0.1, 0.06, 0.05, 0.1, 0.03, 0.1, 0.36, 0.14]

This vector indicates that the text primarily conveys emotions of sadness, melancholy, nostalgia, and a moderate sense of trust. The emotions of happiness and love are expressed to a lesser extent, while other emotions like fear, disgust, anger, surprise, anticipation, distrust, saudade, awe, and bittersweetness have lower intensities or are not significantly present in the text.
