To analyze the emotional content of the text and create the emotion vector representing the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 1, I will first evaluate for prominent emotions in the text. 

Based on the emotional content of the text, the emotion vector could be as follows:

[Happiness: 0.2, Sadness: 0.6, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0.1, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.6, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.7, Saudade: 0.2, Awe: 0.3, Bittersweetness: 0.8, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0.4]

This is just one interpretation of emotions in the text, and different readers may perceive and interpret the emotional content differently.
