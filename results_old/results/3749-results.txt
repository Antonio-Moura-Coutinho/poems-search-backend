To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will need to interpret the emotions conveyed through the words used in the text. After analyzing the text, we can determine the following emotional intensities:

- Happiness: 0.2
- Sadness: 0.3
- Fear: 0.1
- Disgust: 0.1
- Anger: 0.2
- Surprise: 0.1
- Anticipation: 0.3
- Trust: 0.1
- Distrust: 0.2
- Love: 0.1
- Saudade: 0
- Awe: 0
- Bittersweetness: 0.2
- Melancholy: 0.3
- Nostalgia: 0

Therefore, the emotion vector representing the emotional content of the text is: [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0].
