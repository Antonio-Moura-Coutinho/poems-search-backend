To analyze the emotional content of the text, we can identify the following emotions present in the text:

- Fear: Fear can be felt through the reference to the "grim, stingy doorstep" and the idea of slipping past the brink, which may evoke a sense of uncertainty or unease.
- Anticipation: Anticipation is captured in the mention of the "liminal verge" and the idea of passing a threshold, indicating a sense of looking ahead or waiting for something to happen.
- Surprise: A hint of surprise is present in the imagery of blinking and the unexpected transitions depicted in the text.

Based on the emotional analysis, the emotion vector for the text could be as follows:
[0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This vector represents a moderate level of fear, some anticipation, and a touch of surprise in the text.
