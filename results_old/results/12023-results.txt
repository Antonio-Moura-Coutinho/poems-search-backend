The text "Metropolitan Forecast" does not contain explicit emotional content, making it difficult to extract emotions directly from it. As such, the emotion vector would likely show low levels (closer to 0) for most emotions. However, I can provide a general emotion vector based on the neutral nature of the text:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This generic vector signifies the absence of specific emotions in the text "Metropolitan Forecast." Let me know if you would like assistance with anything else!
