[Happiness: 0, Sadness: 0.1, Fear: 0.3, Disgust: 0.2, Anger: 0.2, Surprise: 0.1, Anticipation: 0.4, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0.2, Love: 0, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0.1, Bittersweetness: 0.2, Melancholy: 0.3, Nostalgia: 0.1]

This vector suggests that the text conveys a mix of emotions, with a higher presence of fear, disgust, and anticipation, along with elements of sadness, anger, distrust, bittersweetness, and melancholy. There are also hints of surprise, trust, awe, and nostalgia in the text.
