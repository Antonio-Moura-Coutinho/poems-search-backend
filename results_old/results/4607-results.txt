To analyze the emotional content of the text and output an emotion vector, I will need to examine the underlying emotions expressed in the text. From the text, it is clear that there are various emotions depicted, including sadness, melancholy, and nostalgia. The overall tone appears introspective and contemplative, with themes of loss and yearning woven throughout.

Based on the emotional content of the text, the emotion vector could be as follows:

[0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0.6, 0.8]

This vector indicates a higher intensity of emotions such as sadness, melancholy, and nostalgia, with lower or negligible levels of other emotions. The focus seems to be on reflective and wistful emotions rather than intense feelings of joy or surprise.
