Let's analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector based on the intensity of each emotion. Here is the emotion vector for the provided text:

[0.2, 0.6, 0.6, 0.3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.4, 0.15, 0, 0.5, 0.6, 0.3]

This vector indicates a moderate level of sadness, fear, anger, and distrust, along with some elements of happiness, surprise, love, bittersweetness, melancholy, and nostalgia in the text. The emotions of anticipation, trust, saudade, and awe also have a lower level of intensity in this text.
