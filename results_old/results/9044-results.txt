To analyze the emotional content of the text given, we will need to identify and quantify the intensity of different emotions expressed. After analyzing the text, we can provide an emotion vector representing the intensities of various emotions. Let's begin by identifying the emotions present in the text:

1. Love (Love me Sweet, Love me, Love me with, I will love thee)
2. Happiness (Expressions of love, devotion, and admiration)
3. Trust (Expressing trust, surrender, vowing, angels round thee)
4. Anticipation (Longing for love, expressing desires and hopes)

Based on the emotional content of the text, we can construct the emotion vector as follows:

[Happiness: 0.9, Sadness: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.8, Trust: 0.7, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.9, Saudade: 0, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0, Melancholy: 0, Nostalgia: 0] 

This emotion vector indicates a high intensity of Happiness, Love, Anticipation, and Trust in the text, while the other emotions are not prominently featured.
