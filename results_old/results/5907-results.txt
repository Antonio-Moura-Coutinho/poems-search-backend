To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, I will first examine the emotions conveyed through the language and themes presented in the text. The poem describes a mix of nostalgia, melancholy, and reminiscence about a past time that was perceived as blessed despite the hardships of war. There are elements of love, camaraderie, and reflection on past experiences, as well as a sense of loss and sorrow associated with war.

Based on the emotional analysis, the emotion vector for the text could be as follows:

[Happiness: 0.1, Sadness: 0.5, Fear: 0.1, Disgust: 0, Anger: 0, Surprise: 0, Anticipation: 0.2, Trust: 0.3, Distrust: 0, Love: 0.4, Saudade: 0.5, Awe: 0, Bittersweetness: 0.4, Melancholy: 0.6, Nostalgia: 0.5]

This emotion vector represents the intensity of each emotion mentioned in the text on a scale from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a stronger presence of that emotion in the text.
