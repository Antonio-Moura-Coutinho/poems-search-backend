To analyze the emotional content of the text and create an emotion vector, we will go through the text looking for emotional cues. Based on the language used and the context, we can identify the following emotions and their intensities:

- Happiness: The text conveys a sense of happiness with phrases like "happy the skies," "merry bells," and "cheerful sound." This emotion appears to be prominent throughout the text.
- Anticipation: There is an element of anticipation with the mention of welcoming the Spring and engaging in sports on the Ecchoing Green.
- Love: The reminiscence of past joys and youth-time experiences suggests a feeling of love and nostalgia towards those memories.

Given these emotional cues, the estimated emotion vector for the text could be:

[0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0]

Please note that emotions can be subjective, and different interpretations are possible.
